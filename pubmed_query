AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the SPAST gene are the most frequent cause of hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP). We aim to extend the mutation spectrum of spastic 
      paraplegia 4 (SPG4) and carried out experiment in vitro to explore the influence of 
      the SPAST gene mutation on the function of corresponding protein. METHODS: 
      Whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification (MLPA) were performed in a cohort of 150 patients clinically diagnosed 
      with HSP. We focus on screening for mutations in SPAST gene and carrying out 
      functional experiments to assess the effects of the novel variants. RESULTS: A total 
      of 34 different mutations in the SPAST gene were identified, of which 10 were novel, 
      including 1 missense (c.1479T > A), 1 nonsense (c.766G > T), 3 splicing 
      (c.1413 + 1_1413+4delGTAA, c.1729-1G > A and c.1536+2T > G) and 5 frameshift 
      mutations (c.1094delC, c.885dupA, c.517_518delAG, c.280delG and c.908dupC). For 7 
      novel non-splicing mutations, functional study showed that accumulated M1 spastin 
      colcocalized with microtubules which was different from a uniformly diffused M87 
      spastin. While an impairment in severing activity was observed in both mutant M1 and 
      mutant M87, except for c.280delG. All 3 novel splicing variants w ere predicted to 
      affect splicing by using bioinformatic programs. However, only c.1536+2T > G had no 
      influence on splice site in vitro, which conflicts with the in-silico analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: We genetically diagnosed 40 SPG4 patients. All the novel non-splicing 
      mutations except for c.280delG were certified to exert an effect on the 
      microtubule-severing and all the novel splicing mutations other than c.1536+2T > G 
      would cause abnormal splicing of the spastin.

AB  - Protein folding is the process by which a polypeptide chain acquires its functional, 
      native 3D structure. Protein misfolding, on the other hand, is a process in which 
      protein fails to fold into its native functional conformation. This misfolding of 
      proteins may lead to precipitation of a number of serious diseases such as Cystic 
      Fibrosis (CF), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic 
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) etc. Protein Quality-control (PQC) systems, consisting of 
      molecular chaperones, proteases and regulatory factors, help in protein folding and 
      prevent its aggregation. At the same time, PQC systems also do sorting and removal 
      of improperly folded polypeptides. Among the major types of PQC systems involved in 
      protein homeostasis are cytosolic, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial 
      ones. The cytosol PQC system includes a large number of component chaperones, such 
      as Nascent-polypeptide-associated Complex (NAC), Hsp40, Hsp70, prefoldin and T 
      Complex Protein-1 (TCP-1) Ring Complex (TRiC). Protein misfolding diseases caused 
      due to defective cytosolic PQC system include diseases involving keratin/collagen 
      proteins, cardiomyopathies, phenylketonuria, PD and ALS. The components of PQC 
      system of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) include Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP), 
      Calnexin (CNX), Calreticulin (CRT), Glucose-regulated Protein GRP94, the 
      thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases, Protein Disulphide Isomerase (PDI) and ERp57. 
      ER-linked misfolding diseases include CF and Familial Neurohypophyseal Diabetes 
      Insipidus (FNDI). The components of mitochondrial PQC system include mitochondrial 
      chaperones such as the Hsp70, the Hsp60/Hsp10 and a set of proteases having AAA+ 
      domains similar to the proteasome that are situated in the matrix or the inner 
      membrane. Protein misfolding diseases caused due to defective mitochondrial PQC 
      system include medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)/Short-chain Acyl-CoA 
      Dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency diseases, hereditary spastic paraplegia. Among 
      therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of various protein misfolding diseases, 
      chaperones have been suggested as potential therapeutic molecules for target based 
      treatment. Chaperones have been advantageous because of their efficient entry and 
      distribution inside the cells, including specific cellular compartments, in 
      therapeutic concentrations. Based on the chemical nature of the chaperones used for 
      therapeutic purposes, molecular, chemical and pharmacological classes of chaperones 
      have been discussed.

TI  - Hereditary Ataxia Overview.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The hereditary ataxias are a group of genetic disorders 
      characterized by slowly progressive incoordination of gait and often associated with 
      poor coordination of hands, speech, and eye movements. Frequently, atrophy of the 
      cerebellum occurs. In this GeneReview the hereditary ataxias are categorized by mode 
      of inheritance and gene (or chromosome locus) in which pathogenic variants occur. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Inherited (genetic) forms of ataxia must be distinguished from 
      the many acquired (non-genetic) causes of ataxia. The genetic forms of ataxia are 
      diagnosed by family history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and molecular 
      genetic testing. GENETIC COUNSELING: The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner. Genetic counseling and 
      risk assessment depend on determination of the specific cause of an inherited ataxia 
      in an individual. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Canes, walkers, and 
      wheelchairs for gait ataxia; use of special devices to assist with handwriting, 
      buttoning, and use of eating utensils; speech therapy and/or computer-based devices 
      for those with dysarthria and severe speech deficits. Prevention of primary 
      manifestations: With the exception of vitamin E therapy for ataxia with vitamin E 
      deficiency (AVED), no specific treatments exist for hereditary ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brainstem pathology is a hallmark feature of ALS, yet most imaging 
      studies focus on cortical grey matter alterations and internal capsule white matter 
      pathology. Brainstem imaging in ALS provides a unique opportunity to appraise 
      descending motor tract degeneration and bulbar lower motor neuron involvement. 
      METHODS: A prospective longitudinal imaging study has been undertaken with 100 
      patients with ALS, 33 patients with PLS, 30 patients with FTD and 100 healthy 
      controls. Volumetric, vertex and morphometric analyses were conducted correcting for 
      demographic factors to characterise disease-specific patterns of brainstem 
      pathology. Using a Bayesian segmentation algorithm, the brainstem was segmented into 
      the medulla, pons and mesencephalon to measure regional volume reductions, shape 
      analyses were performed to ascertain the atrophy profile of each study group and 
      region-of-interest morphometry was used to evaluate focal density alterations. 
      RESULTS: ALS and PLS patients exhibit considerable brainstem atrophy compared to 
      both disease- and healthy controls. Volume reductions in ALS and PLS are dominated 
      by medulla oblongata pathology, but pontine atrophy can also be detected. In ALS, 
      vertex analyses confirm the flattening of the medullary pyramids bilaterally in 
      comparison to healthy controls and widespread pontine shape deformations in contrast 
      to PLS. The ALS cohort exhibit bilateral density reductions in the mesencephalic 
      crura in contrast to healthy controls, central pontine atrophy compared to disease 
      controls, peri-aqueduct mesencephalic and posterior pontine changes in comparison to 
      PLS patients. CONCLUS: ions: Computational brainstem imaging captures the 
      degeneration of both white and grey matter components in ALS. Our longitudinal data 
      indicate progressive brainstem atrophy over time, underlining the biomarker 
      potential of quantitative brainstem measures in ALS. At a time when a multitude of 
      clinical trials are underway worldwide, there is an unprecedented need for accurate 
      biomarkers to monitor disease progression and detect response to therapy. Brainstem 
      imaging is a promising addition to candidate biomarkers of ALS and PLS.

TI  - mRNA as a Novel Treatment Strategy for Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 5.
PG  - 359-370
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2019.10.011 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      loss-of-function mutations in the CYP7B1 gene encoding the oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase 
      involved in bile acid synthesis in the liver. Lack of CYP7B1 leads to an 
      accumulation of its oxysterol substrates, in particular 25-hydroxycholesterol and 
      27-hydroxycholesterol that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and have 
      neurotoxic properties. A potential therapeutic strategy for SPG5 is the replacement 
      of CYP7B1 by administration of mRNA. Here, we studied the intravenous application of 
      formulated mouse and human CYP7B1 mRNA in mice lacking the endogenous Cyp7b1 gene. A 
      single-dose injection of either mouse or human CYP7B1 mRNA led to a pronounced 
      degradation of oxysterols in liver and serum within 2 days of treatment. 
      Pharmacokinetics indicate a single injection of human CYP7B1 mRNA to be effective in 
      reducing oxysterols for at least 5 days. Repetitive applications of mRNA were safe 
      for at least 17 days and resulted in a significant reduction of neurotoxic 
      oxysterols not only in liver and serum but also to some extent in the brain. Our 
      study highlights the potential to use mRNA as a novel therapy to treat patients with 
      SPG5 disease.

TI  - Corticospinal tract damage in HHH syndrome: a metabolic cause of hereditary spastic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome is a 
      rare disorder of urea cycle characterized by progressive pyramidal and cerebellar 
      dysfunction, whose pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Here we describe the 
      spectrum of the long fibers involvement in HHH syndrome, attempting a correlation 
      between clinical, electrophysiological and neuro-radiological data. METHODS: Nine 
      HHH patients were longitudinally evaluated by clinical examination, 
      neurophysiological assessment including motor (MEPs), somato-sensory evoked 
      potentials (PESS) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV), brain and spinal cord MRI 
      RESULTS: All patients had pyramidal dysfunction and 3/9 an overt spastic paraplegia. 
      Mild to moderate cerebellar signs were found in 7/9, intellectual disability in 8/9. 
      At lower limbs, MEPs resulted abnormal in 7/8 patients and PESS in 2/8; peripheral 
      sensory-motor neuropathy was found in 1/9. MRI documented atrophic changes in 
      supra-tentorial brain regions in 6/9 patients, cerebellum in 6/9, spinal cord in 
      3/7. CONCLUSIONS: A predominant corticospinal dysfunction is evident in HHH 
      syndrome, along with milder cerebellar signs, intellectual disability of variable 
      degree and rare peripheral neuropathy. Phenotypical similarities with other 
      disorders affecting the urea cycle (argininemia and pyrroline-5-carboxylate 
      synthetase deficiency) suggest possible common mechanisms contributing in the 
      maintenance of the corticospinal tract integrity. HHH syndrome phenotype largely 
      overlaps with complex Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSPs), in the list of which it 
      should be included, emphasizing the importance to screen all the unsolved cases of 
      HSPs for metabolic biomarkers.

AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spastic paraplegia 4 (SPG4; also known as SPAST-HSP) is 
      characterized by insidiously progressive bilateral lower-limb gait spasticity. More 
      than 50% of affected individuals have some weakness in the legs and impaired 
      vibration sense at the ankles. Sphincter disturbances are very common. Onset is 
      insidious, mostly in young adulthood, although symptoms may start as early as age 
      one year and as late as age 76 years. Intrafamilial variation is considerable. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SPAST-HSP is established in a proband with 
      characteristic clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SPAST 
      identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: 
      Antispastic drugs for leg spasticity; anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs for 
      urinary urgency; regular physiotherapy to stretch spastic muscles and prevent 
      contractures. Consideration of botulinum toxin and intrathecal baclofen when oral 
      drugs are ineffective and spasticity is severe and disabling. Urodynamic evaluation 
      in order to initiate treatment when sphincter disturbances become a problem. 
      Surveillance: Evaluation every 6-12 months to update medications and physical 
      rehabilitation. GENETIC COUNSELING: SPAST-HSP is inherited in an autosomal dominant 
      manner with age-related, nearly complete penetrance and is characterized by 
      significant intrafamilial clinical variability. Most individuals diagnosed with 
      SPAST-HSP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo 
      pathogenic variant is low. Each child of an individual with SPAST-HSP has a 50% 
      chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing and preimplantation 
      genetic testing are possible if a pathogenic SPAST variant has been identified in an 
      affected family member. Because of variable clinical expression, results of prenatal 
      testing cannot be used to predict whether an individual will develop SPAST-HSP and, 
      if so, what the age of onset, clinical course, and degree of disability will be.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and hereditary ataxia (HA) are two groups of 
      disorders characterized, respectively, by progressive dysfunction or degeneration of 
      the pyramidal tracts (HSP) and of the Purkinje cells and spinocerebellar tracts 
      (HA). Although HSP and HA are generally shown to have distinct clinical-genetic 
      profiles, in several cases the clinical presentation, the causative genes, and the 
      cellular pathways and mechanisms involved overlap between the two forms. Genetic 
      analyses in humans in combination with in vitro and in vivo studies using model 
      systems have greatly expanded our knowledge of spinocerebellar degenerative 
      disorders. In this review, we focus on the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a vertebrate 
      model widely used in biomedical research since its overall nervous system 
      organization is similar to that of humans. A critical analysis of the literature 
      suggests that zebrafish could serve as a powerful experimental tool for molecular 
      and genetic dissection of both HA and HSP. The zebrafish, found to be very useful 
      for demonstrating the causal relationship between defect and mutation, also offers a 
      useful platform to exploit for the development of therapies.

AB  - Defects in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane shaping and interaction with 
      other organelles seem to be a crucial mechanism underlying Hereditary Spastic 
      Paraplegia (HSP) neurodegeneration. REEP1, a transmembrane protein belonging to 
      TB2/HVA22 family, is implicated in SPG31, an autosomal dominant form of HSP, and its 
      interaction with Atlastin/SPG3A and Spastin/SPG4, the other two major HSP linked 
      proteins, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modifying ER architecture. 
      In addition, the Drosophila ortholog of REEP1, named ReepA, has been found to 
      regulate the response to ER neuronal stress. Herein we investigated the role of 
      ReepA in ER morphology and stress response. ReepA is upregulated under stress 
      conditions and aging. Our data show that ReepA triggers a selective activation of 
      Ire1 and Atf6 branches of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and modifies ER 
      morphology. Drosophila lacking ReepA showed Atf6 and Ire1 activation, expansion of 
      ER sheet-like structures, locomotor dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Furthermore, 
      we found that naringenin, a flavonoid that possesses strong antioxidant and 
      neuroprotective activity, can rescue the cellular phenotypes, the lifespan and 
      locomotor disability associated with ReepA loss of function. Our data highlight the 
      importance of ER homeostasis in nervous system functionality and HSP 
      neurodegenerative mechanisms, opening new opportunities for HSP treatment.

TI  - Parkinsonism and spastic paraplegia type 7: Expanding the spectrum of mitochondrial 
      Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1547-1561
LID - 10.1002/mds.27812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in the spastic paraplegia type 7 gene cause a 
      complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia phenotype associated with classical 
      features of mitochondrial diseases, including ataxia, progressive external 
      ophthalmoplegia, and deletions of mitochondrial DNA. OBJECTIVES: To better 
      characterize spastic paraplegia type 7 disease with a clinical, genetic, and 
      functional analysis of a Spanish cohort of spastic paraplegia type 7 patients. 
      METHODS: Genetic analysis was performed in patients suspecting hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia and in 1 patient with parkinsonism and Pisa syndrome, through 
      next-generation sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, targeted Sanger sequencing, and 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe analysis, and blood mitochondrial DNA levels 
      determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients 
      were found to carry homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the 
      spastic paraplegia type 7 gene. Mean age at onset was 40 years (range, 12-63); 63% 
      of spastic paraplegia type 7 patients were male, and three-quarters of all patients 
      had at least one allele with the c.1529C>T (p.Ala510Val) mutation. Eighty percent of 
      the cohort showed a complicated phenotype, combining ataxia and progressive external 
      ophthalmoplegia (65% and 26%, respectively). Parkinsonism was observed in 21% of 
      cases. Analysis of blood mitochondrial DNA indicated that both patients and carriers 
      of spastic paraplegia type 7 pathogenic variants had markedly lower levels of 
      mitochondrial DNA than control subjects (228 per haploid nuclear DNA vs. 176 vs. 
      573, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parkinsonism is a frequent finding in 
      spastic paraplegia type 7 patients. Spastic paraplegia type 7 pathogenic variants 
      impair mitochondrial DNA homeostasis irrespective of the number of mutant alleles, 
      type of variant, and patient or carrier status. Thus, spastic paraplegia type 7 
      supports mitochondrial DNA maintenance, and variants in the gene may cause 
      parkinsonism owing to mitochondrial DNA abnormalities. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA 
      blood analysis could be a useful biomarker to detect at risk families. © 2019

AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spastic paraplegia 11 (SPG11) is characterized by 
      progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs frequently associated with 
      the following: mild intellectual disability with learning difficulties in childhood 
      and/or progressive cognitive decline; peripheral neuropathy; pseudobulbar 
      involvement; and increased reflexes in the upper limbs. Less frequent findings 
      include: cerebellar signs (ataxia, nystagmus, saccadic pursuit); retinal 
      degeneration; pes cavus; scoliosis; and parkinsonism with characteristic brain MRI 
      features that include thinning of the corpus callosum. Onset occurs mainly during 
      infancy or adolescence (range: age 1-31 years) and in rare cases as late as age 60 
      years. Most affected individuals become wheelchair bound one or two decades after 
      disease onset. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SPG11 is established in a proband 
      with characteristic clinical and MRI findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in 
      SPG11 identified on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of 
      manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team; physiotherapy to stretch spastic 
      muscles; antispastic drugs such as baclofen; botulin toxin and intrathecal baclofen 
      for severe and disabling spasticity when oral drugs are ineffective. Urodynamic 
      evaluation when bladder dysfunction is evident; anticholinergic drugs for urinary 
      urgency. Treatment of psychiatric manifestations by standard protocols. Prevention 
      of secondary complications: Treatment of sphincter disturbances to prevent urinary 
      tract infection secondary to bladder dysfunction. Surveillance: Evaluation every six 
      months to adjust physiotherapy and medications. GENETIC COUNSELING: SPG11 is 
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If each parent is known to be 
      heterozygous for an SPG11 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has 
      at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family 
      members and prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies are possible once the 
      pathogenic variants in a family are known.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether mutations in ERLIN2, known 
      to cause SPG18, a recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (SP) responsible for the 
      degeneration of the upper motor neurons leading to weakness and spasticity 
      restricted to the lower limbs, could contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), a distinct and more severe motor neuron disease (MND), in which the lower 
      motor neurons also profusely degenerates, leading to tetraplegia, bulbar palsy, 
      respiratory insufficiency, and ultimately the death of the patients. METHODS: 
      Whole-exome sequencing was performed in a large cohort of 200 familial ALS and 60 
      sporadic ALS after a systematic screening for C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansion. ERLIN2 variants identified by exome analysis were validated using Sanger 
      analysis. Segregation of the identified variant with the disease was checked for all 
      family members with available DNA. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of 
      ERLIN2 mutations in patients with a primarily SP evolving to rapid progressive ALS, 
      leading to the death of the patients. These mutations segregated with the disease in 
      a dominant (V168M) or recessive (D300V) manner in these families or were found in 
      apparently sporadic cases (N125S). CONCLUSIONS: Inheritance of ERLIN2 mutations 
      appears to be, within the MND spectrum, more complex that previously reported. These 
      results expand the clinical phenotype of ERLIN2 mutations to a severe outcome of MND 
      and should be considered before delivering a genetic counseling to ERLIN2-linked 
      families.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. Genetic factors play a key role 
      in ALS, and identifying variants that contribute to ALS susceptibility is an 
      important step toward understanding the etiology of the disease. The frequency of 
      protein altering variants in ALS patients has been extensively investigated in 
      populations of different ethnic origin. To further delineate the genetic 
      architecture of the Hungarian ALS patients, we aimed to detect potentially damaging 
      variants in major and minor ALS genes and in genes related to other neurogenetic 
      disorders. A combination of repeat-sizing of C9orf72 and next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS) was used to comprehensively assess genetic variations in 107 Hungarian 
      patients with ALS. Variants in major ALS genes were detected in 36.45% of patients. 
      As a result of repeat sizing, pathogenic repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene were 
      detected in 10 patients (9.3%). According to the NGS results, the most frequently 
      mutated genes were NEK1 (5.6%), NEFH, SQSTM1 (3.7%), KIF5A, SPG11 (2.8%), ALS2, 
      CCNF, FUS, MATR3, TBK1, and UBQLN2 (1.9%). Furthermore, potentially pathogenic 
      variants were found in GRN and SIGMAR1 genes in single patients. Additional 33 novel 
      or rare known variants were detected in minor ALS genes, as well as 48 variants in 
      genes previously linked to other neurogenetic disorders. The latter finding supports 
      the hypothesis that common pathways in different neurodegenerative diseases may 
      contribute to the development of ALS. While the disease-causing role of several 
      variants identified in this study has previously been established, other variants 
      may show reduced penetrance or may be rare benign variants. Our findings highlight 
      the necessity for large-scale multicenter studies on ALS patients to gain a more 
      accurate view of the genetic pattern of ALS.

TI  - MitCHAP-60 and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia SPG-13 Arise from an Inactive hsp60 
      Chaperonin that Fails to Fold the ATP Synthase β-Subunit.
PG  - 12300
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-48762-5 [doi]
LID - 12300
AB  - The human mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) is a tetradecameric chaperonin 
      that folds proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. An hsp60 D3G mutation leads to 
      MitCHAP-60, an early onset neurodegenerative disease while hsp60 V72I has been 
      linked to SPG13, a form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Previous studies have 
      suggested that these mutations impair the protein folding activity of hsp60 
      complexes but the detailed mechanism by which these mutations lead the neuromuscular 
      diseases remains unknown. It is known, is that the β-subunit of the human 
      mitochondrial ATP synthase co-immunoprecipitates with hsp60 indicating that the 
      β-subunit is likely a substrate for the chaperonin. Therefore, we hypothesized that 
      hsp60 mutations cause misfolding of proteins that are critical for aerobic 
      respiration. Negative-stain electron microscopy and DLS results suggest that the D3G 
      and V72I complexes fall apart when treated with ATP or ADP and are therefore unable 
      to fold denatured substrates such as α-lactalbumin, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and 
      the β-subunit of ATP synthase in in-vitro protein-folding assays. These data 
      suggests that hsp60 plays a crucial role in folding important players in aerobic 
      respiration such as the β-subunit of the ATP synthase. The hsp60 mutations D3G and 
      V72I impair its ability to fold mitochondrial substrates leading to abnormal ATP 
      synthesis and the development of the MitCHAP-60 and SPG13 neuromuscular degenerative 
      disorders.

TI  - Genotype-phenotype associations in hereditary spastic paraplegia: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis on 13,570 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09633-1 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of 
      inherited neurodegenerative disorders. Although, several genotype-phenotype studies 
      have carried out on HSPs, the association between genotypes and clinical phenotypes 
      remain incomplete since most studies are small in size or restricted to a few genes. 
      Accordingly, this study provides the systematic meta-analysis of genotype-phenotype 
      associations in HSP. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrieved literature on 
      genotype-phenotype associations in patients with HSP and mutated SPAST, REEP1, ATL1, 
      SPG11, SPG15, SPG7, SPG35, SPG54, SPG5. In total, 147 studies with 13,570 HSP 
      patients were included in our meta-analysis. The frequency of mutations in SPAST 
      (25%) was higher than REEP1 (3%), as well as ATL1 (5%) in AD-HSP patients. As for 
      AR-HSP patients, the rates of mutations in SPG11 (18%), SPG15 (7%) and SPG7 (13%) 
      were higher than SPG5 (5%), as well as SPG35 (8%) and SPG54 (7%). The mean age of 
      AD-HSP onset for ATL1 mutation-positive patients was earlier than patients with 
      SPAST, REEP1 mutations. Also, the tendency toward younger age at AR-HSP onset for 
      SPG35 was higher than other mutated genes. It is noteworthy that the mean age at HSP 
      onset ranged from infancy to adulthood. As for the gender distribution, the male 
      proportion in SPG7-HSP (90%) and REEP1-HSP (78%) was markedly high. The frequency of 
      symptoms was varied among patients with different mutated genes. The rates of LL 
      weakness, superficial sensory abnormalities, neuropathy, and deep sensory impairment 
      were noticeably high in REEP1 mutations carriers. Also, in AR-HSP patients with 
      SPG11 mutations, the presentation of symptoms including pes cavus, Neuropathy, and 
      UL spasticity was higher. CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive genotype-phenotype 
      assessment of available data displays that the mean age at disease onset and 
      particular sub-phenotypes are associated with specific mutated genes which might be 
      beneficial for a diagnostic procedure and differentiation of the specific mutated 
      genes phenotype among diverse forms of HSP.

TI  - Recruitment of monocytes and epigenetic silencing of intratumoral CYP7B1 primarily 
      contribute to the accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in breast cancer.
PG  - 2194-2208
AB  - Previous studies showed that intratumoral 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-HC), a 
      metabolite of cholesterol, promotes growth, invasion and migration of breast cancer 
      cells and that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in breast cancers are closely 
      related to tumor growth and metastatic progression. However, the relationship 
      between 27-HC and TAMs in breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we 
      observed that CYP27A1, the 27-HC synthesizing enzyme, was expressed in a much higher 
      level in THP1 monocytes and THP1-derived macrophages than in breast cancer cells, 
      and the promoter of CYP7B1, the degrading enzyme for 27-HC, was highly methylated in 
      breast tumor cells. In addition, THP-1 monocytes and murine bone marrow cells were 
      differentiated toward M2 type macrophages after being co-cultured with breast cancer 
      cells or being exposed to exosomes derived from breast cancer cells. M2 type 
      macrophages produced higher amounts of 27-HC than M0 and M1 type macrophages. 27-HC 
      not only stimulated ER+ cancer cell proliferation as reported, but also promoted the 
      recruitment of CCR2- and CCR5-expressing monocytes by inducing macrophages to 
      express multiple chemokines including CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4. Taken together, our data 
      demonstrate that the hypermethylation of CYP7B1 and recruitment of monocytes likely 
      contribute to the accumulation of 27-Hydroxycholesterol in breast cancer and that 
      the interaction of 27-HC with macrophages further promote the development of breast 
      cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and Zellweger spectrum disorder 
      (ZSD) are peroxisomal diseases characterized by accumulation of very long chain 
      fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues. Considering the wide variability of 
      manifestation, patients of ALD and atypical ZSD are easily misdiagnosed as 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) on their clinical grounds. Here, we aimed to 
      determine the frequency of peroxisome diseases and compare their phenotypic spectra 
      with HSP. METHODS: We first applied targeted sequencing in 120 pedigrees with 
      spastic paraplegia, and subsequently confirmed 74 HSP families. We then performed 
      whole exome sequencing for the probands of the 46 remaining pedigrees lacking known 
      HSP-causal genes. Detailed clinical, radiological features, and VLCFA analyses are 
      presented. RESULTS: Seven ALD pedigrees with ABCD1 mutations and one ZSD family 
      harboring bi-allelic mutations of PEX16 were identified. Clinically, in addition to 
      spastic paraplegia, four ALD probands presented adrenocortical insufficiency, and 
      the ZSD proband and her affected sister both developed thyroid problems. VLCFA 
      analysis showed that ratios of C24/C22 and C26/C22 were specifically increased in 
      ALD probands. Moreover, three ALD probands and the ZSD proband had abnormalities in 
      brain or spinal imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports the first ZSD case in China 
      that manifested spastic paraplegia, and emphasized the finding that peroxisomal 
      diseases comprise a significant proportion (8/120) of spastic paraplegia entities. 
      These findings extend our current understanding of the ALD and ZSD diseases.

TI  - Physical therapy intervention with a low frequency of exercise for a patient with a 
      complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia: a case report.
PG  - 545-549
LID - 10.1589/jpts.31.545 [doi]
AB  - [Purpose] Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. To date, 
      the appropriate frequency and intensity of physical therapy for patients with HSP 
      are not well-known. We created an original rehabilitation program for a patient with 
      a complicated form of HSP, wherein the program required low-frequency involvement to 
      adapt to the long-term insurance system in Japan. We wanted to find out whether this 
      program could maintain the physical functions and activities of daily living (ADL) 
      of the patient. [Participant and Methods] A 41-year-old male diagnosed with a 
      complicated form of HSP with decreased visual acuity and ataxia of the trunk and 
      upper limb underwent a specific rehabilitation program that included a squatting 
      exercise, a kneeling position exercise, and a motion exercise of taking a bath. This 
      intervention program lasted for 20 minutes per session, with a frequency of two days 
      per week. The patient was in the program for 12 weeks. [Results] All outcome 
      measures, including muscle strength (grip force and quadriceps) and Barthel index, 
      remained unchanged at the end of the intervention program. [Conclusion] The original 
      intervention program used in this study, which had a low frequency of exercise, was 
      effective in preventing further regression of the lower limb function of the patient 
      with a complicated form of HSP, and in preventing a decrease in the ability of the 
      patient to perform ADL.

TI  - A p.Arg499His Mutation in SPAST Is Associated with Infantile Onset Ascending Spastic 
      Paralysis Complicated with Dysarthria and Anarthria.
PG  - 391-394
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1694973 [doi]
AB  - The complication of anarthria in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) patients has 
      been reported to result from mutations in either ALS2 or FA2H. Here, we present a 
      case of a 12-year-old boy with hereditary spastic paralysis and anarthria associated 
      with a SPAST mutation. Initial presentation was at 14 months of age, when the 
      patient experienced leg stiffness. At 3 years of age, he could speak well using 
      sentences. At 9 years of age, he was found to have dysarthria and had difficulty 
      writing. At 12 years of age, the ability to speak was lost. The patient could not 
      vocalize any words, despite contraction of his neck and respiratory muscles during 
      attempted vocalization. Additionally, the patient has never walked independently in 
      his life. Considering these symptoms, we diagnosed him as having infantile onset 
      ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) complicated with anarthria. By 
      whole-exome sequencing, we discovered a heterozygous SPAST mutation c.1496G > A 
      (p.Arg499His), which was not found in the parents and is probably de novo. This 
      mutation was already repeatedly described with similar phenotype. Our results 
      suggest that the p.Arg499His mutation in SPAST should be considered as a 
      differential diagnosis in IAHSP.

TI  - KIF1A variants are a frequent cause of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia.
PG  - 40-49
LID - 10.1038/s41431-019-0497-z [doi]
AB  - Variants in the KIF1A gene can cause autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia 30, 
      autosomal recessive hereditary sensory neuropathy, or autosomal (de novo) dominant 
      mental retardation type 9. More recently, variants in KIF1A have also been described 
      in a few cases with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. Here, we describe 20 
      KIF1A variants in 24 patients from a clinical exome sequencing cohort of 347 
      individuals with a mostly 'pure' spastic paraplegia. In these patients, spastic 
      paraplegia was slowly progressive and mostly pure, but with a highly variable 
      disease onset (0-57 years). Segregation analyses showed a de novo occurrence in 
      seven cases, and a dominant inheritance pattern in 11 families. The motor domain of 
      KIF1A is a hotspot for disease causing variants in autosomal dominant spastic 
      paraplegia, similar to mental retardation type 9 and recessive spastic paraplegia 
      type 30. However, unlike these allelic disorders, dominant spastic paraplegia was 
      also caused by loss-of-function variants outside this domain in six families. 
      Finally, three missense variants were outside the motor domain and need further 
      characterization. In conclusion, KIF1A variants are a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spastic paraplegia in our cohort (6-7%). The identification of KIF1A 
      loss-of-function variants suggests haploinsufficiency as a possible mechanism in 
      autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia.

TI  - VPS53 gene is associated with a new phenotype of complicated hereditary spastic 
      paraparesis.
PG  - 187-195
LID - 10.1007/s10048-019-00586-1 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
      characterized by progressive lower limb weakness and spasticity. Multiple genes are 
      associated with both the pure and complicated HSP types. Our study is aimed at 
      seeking for novel genetic basis of HSP in a family with two affected siblings. 
      Genetic analysis using whole exome sequencing was conducted in a family quartet with 
      two female siblings, who presented with complicated HSP featuring slowly progressive 
      paraparesis, mild-moderate intellectual disability, normal head circumference (HC), 
      and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A homozygous pathogenic variant was 
      identified in both siblings in the VPS53 gene (c.2084A>G: c.2084A>G, p.Gln695Arg). 
      This gene acts as a component of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) 
      complex that is involved, among others, in intracellular cholesterol transport and 
      sphingolipid homeostasis in lysosomes and was previously associated with progressive 
      cerebello-cerebral atrophy (PCCA) type 2. This is the first description of the VPS53 
      gene as a cause of autosomal recessive complicated HSP. Lysosomal dysfunction as a 
      result of impaired cholesterol trafficking can explain the neurodegenerative 
      processes responsible for the HSP. Our finding expands the phenotype of 
      VPS53-related disease and warrants the addition of VPS53 analysis to the genetic 
      investigation in patients with autosomal recessive HSP. The exact role of GARP 
      complex in neurodegenerative processes should be further elucidated.

AB  - The number of molecularly defined degenerative ataxia diseases is rapidly 
      increasing, many of them involving complex multisystemic presentations including 
      parkinsonism. The increasing number of novel ataxia genes -with most of them being 
      ultra-rare - often makes it difficult for clinicians and scientists to identify the 
      molecular diagnosis underlying these ataxia-parkinsonism syndromes. Here we aim to 
      provide an overview on the most frequent diseases and molecular causes underlying 
      ataxia-parkinsonism, focusing both on novel aspects of well-known causes of 
      ataxia-parkinsonism (MSA-C, PSP-C, FXTAS, repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias 
      [SCAs], conventional mutation SCAs) as well as on more recently identified rare 
      genetic causes of ataxia-parkinsonism (AT, POLG, SPG7). We demonstrate that 
      frequency data and phenotype characteristics help to guide diagnostics in patients 
      with unexplained ataxia-parkinsonism, while the newly identified rare genetic causes 
      of ataxia-parkinsonism provide novel insights into molecular key pathways underlying 
      the shared vulnerability of cerebellar and basal ganglia neurons.

AB  - Epilepsy is a serious neurological disease characterized by recurrent unprovoked 
      seizures. The exact etiology of epilepsy is not fully understood. Protrudin is a 
      neural membrane protein and is found to be mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      that characterized by symptoms like seizures. Here, we reported that the expression 
      of protrudin was downregulated in the temporal neocortex of epileptic patients and 
      in the hippocampus and cortex of pentylenetetrazol and kainic acid-kindled epileptic 
      mouse models. Behavioral and electroencephalogram analyses indicated that 
      overexpression of protrudin in the mouse hippocampus increased the latency of the 
      seizure and decreased the frequency and duration of seizure activity. Using 
      whole-cell patch clamp, overexpression of protrudin in the mouse hippocampus 
      resulted in a reduction in action potential frequency and an increase in 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory current amplitude. Moreover, western 
      blot analysis showed that the membrane expression of the GABA A receptor β2/3 
      subunit was also upregulated after protrudin overexpression, and 
      coimmunoprecipitation resulted in a protein-protein interaction between protrudin, 
      GABA(A)Rβ2/3 and GABA receptor-associated protein in the hippocampus of epileptic 
      mice. These findings suggest that protrudin probably inhibits the occurrence and 
      development of epilepsy through the regulation of GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic 
      transmission, and protrudin might be a promising target for the treatment of 
      epilepsy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the nationwide prevalence of primary dystonia, ataxia and 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in Sweden. METHODS: We extracted data on all 
      patients who were registered in The National Patient Register (NPR) in Sweden 
      (population 9.64 million) at least twice during five consecutive years with a 
      diagnosis of primary dystonia, ataxia or HSP. We excluded patients with an 
      additional diagnosis possibly indicating secondary causes, and determined the 
      proportion of wrongly diagnosed patients at our own tertiary center by patient 
      examination or chart review. We analyzed patients' age and disorder subtypes, 
      geographical distribution of patients within Sweden and the country of birth of all 
      patients. RESULTS: Nationwide, we identified 4239 patients (31.6% male) with a 
      diagnosis of primary dystonia. Of 347 patients with dystonia at our center, 20.2% 
      may have had a different final diagnosis. Extrapolation of this uncertainty rate to 
      the national population resulted in a prevalence for primary dystonia of 
      35.1/100,000. There were 672 patients (49.6% male) with ataxia in NPR, and the 
      diagnostic uncertainty rate among 81 patients in our center was 13.6% (prevalence 
      6.0/100,000). HSP was diagnosed in 235 patients nationwide (52.3% male, prevalence 
      2.4/100,000). Patients were distributed relatively evenly throughout the country. 
      The proportions of patients with these diagnoses who were born outside of Sweden 
      were lower (8.0-12.7%) than the proportion of all Swedish residents born abroad 
      (15.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, nationwide study, the prevalence of dystonia 
      was high compared to previous studies, which partly may be explained by the high 
      coverage of NPR.

TI  - Clinical and genetic spectrum of an orphan disease MPAN: a series with new variants 
      and a novel phenotype.
PG  - 476-483
LID - 10.5603/PJNNS.a2019.0062 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pathogenic variations in C19orf12 are responsible for two allelic 
      diseases: mitochondrial membrane protein-associated neurodegeneration (MPAN); and 
      spastic paraplegia type 43 (SPG43). MPAN is an orphan disease, which presents with 
      spasticity, dystonia, peripheral nerve involvement, and dementia. The pattern of 
      iron accumulation on brain MRI may be a clue for the diagnosis of MPAN. SPG43, on 
      the other hand, is characterised by progressive lower limb spasticity without brain 
      iron accumulation. We here present clinical and genetic findings of MPAN patients 
      with potentially pathogenic C19orf12 variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from 
      13 different families having progressive motor symptoms with irritative pyramidal 
      signs and brain iron accumulation were screened for C19orf12 gene variants. RESULTS: 
      C19orf12 screening identified seven variants associated with MPAN in eight patients 
      from seven families. We associated two pathogenic variants (c.24G > C; p.(Lys8Asn) 
      and c.194G > A; p.(Gly65Glu)) with the MPAN phenotype for the first time. We also 
      provided a genetic diagnosis for a patient with an atypical MPAN presentation. The 
      variant c.32C > T; p.(Thr11Met), common to Turkish adult-onset MPAN patients, was 
      also detected in two unrelated late-onset MPAN patients. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic 
      analysis along with thorough clinical analysis supported by radiological findings 
      will aid the differential diagnosis of MPAN within the neurodegeneration with brain 
      iron accumulation spectrum as well as other disorders including hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia. Dystonia and parkinsonism may not be the leading clinical findings in 
      MPAN patients, as these are absent in the atypical case. Finally, we emphasise that 
      the existence of frameshifting variants may bias the age of onset toward childhood.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) comprises a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders, it share common symptom - of progressive lower spastic 
      paraparesis. The most common autosomal dominant (AD) forms of HSP are SPG4 (SPAST 
      gene) and SPG3 (ATL1 gene). In the current research we investigated for the first 
      time the distribution of pathogenic mutations in SPAST and ATL1 genes within a large 
      cohort of Russian HSP patients (122 probands; 69 famillial cases). We determined the 
      frequencies of genetic abnormalities using Sanger sequencing, multiplex 
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) 
      of targeted gene panels. As a result, SPG4 was diagnosed in 30.3% (37/122) of HSP 
      cases, where the familial cases represented 37.7% (26/69) of SPG4. In total 31 
      pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were detected in SPAST, with 14 new 
      mutations. Among all detected SPAST variants, 29% were gross deletions and 
      duplications. The proportion of SPG3 variants in Russian cohort was 8.2% (10/122) 
      that were all familial cases. All 10 detected ATL1 mutations were missense 
      substitutions, most of which were in the mutational hot spots of 4, 7, 8, 12 exons, 
      with 2 novel mutations. This work will be helpful for the populational genetics of 
      HSP understanding.

TI  - Disease-associated mutations hyperactivate KIF1A motility and anterograde axonal 
      transport of synaptic vesicle precursors.
PG  - 18429-18434
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1905690116 [doi]
AB  - KIF1A is a kinesin family motor involved in the axonal transport of synaptic vesicle 
      precursors (SVPs) along microtubules (MTs). In humans, more than 10 point mutations 
      in KIF1A are associated with the motor neuron disease hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (SPG). However, not all of these mutations appear to inhibit the motility of the 
      KIF1A motor, and thus a cogent molecular explanation for how KIF1A mutations lead to 
      neuropathy is not available. In this study, we established in vitro motility assays 
      with purified full-length human KIF1A and found that KIF1A mutations associated with 
      the hereditary SPG lead to hyperactivation of KIF1A motility. Introduction of the 
      corresponding mutations into the Caenorhabditis elegans KIF1A homolog unc-104 
      revealed abnormal accumulation of SVPs at the tips of axons and increased 
      anterograde axonal transport of SVPs. Our data reveal that hyperactivation of 
      kinesin motor activity, rather than its loss of function, is a cause of motor neuron 
      disease in humans.

TI  - Globular glial tauopathy caused by MAPT P301T mutation: clinical and 
      neuropathological findings.
PG  - 2396-2405
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09414-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, biochemical, and neuropathological findings of 
      an autosomal dominant globular glial tauopathy caused by the P301T mutation at the 
      MAPT gene. METHODS: Five patients from two unrelated pedigrees underwent clinical 
      evaluation. Genetic analysis, brain pathological examination, and biochemical 
      analysis of tau were performed. RESULTS: The patients studied were 3 men and 2 women 
      with a mean age at onset of 52.2 years and mean disease duration of 5.2 years. Three 
      patients presented a corticobasal syndrome, one patient an asymmetric pyramidal 
      syndrome compatible with primary lateral sclerosis, and one patient a frontotemporal 
      dementia. In both pedigrees (4 patients) Sanger sequencing showed the p.P301T 
      mutation in exon 10 of the MAPT gene. Neuropathological findings consisted of 
      atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes with marked spongiosis and astrogliosis, and 
      abundant phosphorylated tau protein deposits in the frontal and temporal cortex, 
      limbic area, basal ganglia, and brain stem. The most striking finding was the 
      presence of oligodendroglial 4R phospho-tau globular positive inclusions in the 
      white matter and cortex. Globose-type neurofibrillary neuronal tangles, and in 
      particular astrocytic globular inclusions and coarse tufts, were present in the grey 
      matter. Biochemical analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions revealed two tau bands 
      of 64 and 68 kDa and case-dependent bands of lower molecular weight. CONCLUSION: 
      This is the first pathological and biochemical study of the MAPT p.P301T mutation 
      showing variable clinical manifestation and neuropathological phenotype of globular 
      glial tauopathy not only among different families but also within families.

TI  - Novel ATL1 mutation in a Chinese family with hereditary spastic paraplegia: A case 
      report and review of literature.
PG  - 1358-1366
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v7.i11.1358 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) refer to a group of heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative diseases characterized by lower limbs spasticity and weakness. So 
      far, over 72 genes have been found to cause HSP (SPG1-SPG72). Among autosomal 
      dominant HSP patients, spastic paraplegia 4 (SPG4/SPAST) gene is the most common 
      pathogenic gene, and atlastin-1 (ATL1) is the second most common one. Here we 
      reported a novel ATL1 mutation in a Chinese spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A) family, 
      which expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of ATL1 mutations. CASE SUMMARY: A 
      9-year-old boy with progressive spastic paraplegia accompanied by right hearing loss 
      and mental retardation for five years was admitted to our hospital. Past history was 
      unremarkable. The family history was positive, and his grandfather and mother had 
      similar symptoms. Neurological examinations revealed hypermyotonia in his lower 
      limbs, hyperreflexia in knee reflex, bilateral positive Babinski signs and scissors 
      gait. The results of blood routine test, liver function test, blood glucose test, 
      ceruloplasmin test and vitamin test were all normal. The serum lactic acid level was 
      significantly increased. The testing for brainstem auditory evoked potential 
      demonstrated that the right side hearing was impaired while the left was normal. 
      Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild atrophy of the spinal cord. The gene panel 
      test revealed that the proband carried an ATL1 c.752A>G p.Gln251Arg (p.Q251R) 
      mutation, and Sanger sequencing confirmed the existence of family co-segregation. 
      CONCLUSION: We reported a novel ATL1 Q251R mutation and a novel clinical phenotype 
      of hearing loss in a Chinese SPG3A family.

TI  - Primary lateral sclerosis: consensus diagnostic criteria.
PG  - 373-377
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2019-322541 [doi]
AB  - Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the adult motor 
      system. Characterised by a slowly progressive upper motor neuron syndrome, the 
      diagnosis is clinical, after exclusion of structural, neurodegenerative and 
      metabolic mimics. Differentiation of PLS from upper motor neuron-predominant forms 
      of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains a significant challenge in the early 
      symptomatic phase of both disorders, with ongoing debate as to whether they form a 
      clinical and histopathological continuum. Current diagnostic criteria for PLS may be 
      a barrier to therapeutic development, requiring long delays between symptom onset 
      and formal diagnosis. While new technologies sensitive to both upper and lower motor 
      neuron involvement may ultimately resolve controversies in the diagnosis of PLS, we 
      present updated consensus diagnostic criteria with the aim of reducing diagnostic 
      delay, optimising therapeutic trial design and catalysing the development of 
      disease-modifying therapy.

TI  - The acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis: Not just an alternative pathway(☆).
PG  - 88-98
LID - 10.1016/j.livres.2019.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Over the last two decades, the prevalence of obesity, and metabolic syndromes (MS) 
      such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2DM), have dramatically increased. Bile acids play a major role in the digestion, 
      absorption of nutrients, and the body's redistribution of absorbed lipids as a 
      function of their chemistry and signaling properties. As a result, a renewed 
      interest has developed in the bile acid metabolic pathways with the challenge of 
      gaining insight into novel treatment approaches for this rapidly growing healthcare 
      problem. Of the two major pathways of bile acid synthesis in the liver, the foremost 
      role of the acidic (alternative) pathway is to generate and control the levels of 
      regulatory oxysterols that help control cellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. 
      Cholesterol transport to mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) by 
      steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StarD1), and the subsequent 7α-hydroxylation 
      of oxysterols by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) are the key regulatory steps of 
      the pathway. Recent observations suggest CYP7B1 to be the ultimate controller of 
      cellular oxysterol levels. This review discusses the acidic pathway and its 
      contribution to lipid, cholesterol, carbohydrate, and energy homeostasis. 
      Additionally, discussed is how the acidic pathway's dysregulation not only leads to 
      a loss in its ability to control cellular cholesterol and lipid homeostasis, but 
      leads to inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Genetic and Clinical Profile of Chinese Patients with Autosomal Dominant Spastic 
      Paraplegia.
PG  - 781-789
LID - 10.1007/s40291-019-00426-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) refers to a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by bilateral weakness, spasticity, and 
      hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. The autosomal dominant HSP (ADHSP) predominantly 
      presents as the pure form, but the clinical profiles and causal genetic variants 
      underlying ADHSP are complex, and many remain unknown. METHODS: A cohort of 15 
      Chinese HSP pedigrees (including 35 patients and their 22 relatives) were screened 
      by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES). Neurological assessments were also conducted. RESULTS: The main subtypes of 
      HSP above detected in our cohort were SPG4, SPG3A, and SPG6. Fifteen HSP-inducing 
      mutations were identified, among which six were novel mutations: SPAST c.1277T>C, 
      c.1292G>C, c.1562T>C, and c.1693A>T, NIPA1 c.748A>C, and KIDINS220 c.4448C>G. As 
      expected, the most common presentation of the ADHSP cases was the pure form, 
      manifesting spasticity of lower limbs and hyperreflexia, as well as pyramidal signs. 
      Differing substantially from previous reports for KIDINS220 variants, our study 
      family exhibited autosomal dominant inheritance, and only presented with spastic 
      paraplegia, with no signs of intellectual disability, nystagmus, or obesity. 
      CONCLUSION: Our work reveals a non-classical spastic paraplegia, intellectual 
      disability, nystagmus, and obesity phenotype for a KIDINS220 mutation, which 
      broadens both the clinical and genetic spectrum for ADHSP. Beyond underscoring the 
      utility of using both MLPA and WES in studies of HSP, our work deepens the 
      scientific understanding of phenotypes for ADHSP and defines new genetic variants to 
      facilitate future diagnoses.

TI  - Spastin MIT Domain Disease-Associated Mutations Disrupt Lysosomal Function.
PG  - 1179
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2019.01179 [doi]
LID - 1179
AB  - The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetic motor neuron diseases 
      characterized by progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract axons. Mutations in 
      SPAST, encoding the microtubule-severing ATPase spastin, are the most common causes 
      of HSP. The broad SPAST mutational spectrum indicates a haploinsufficiency 
      pathogenic mechanism in most cases. Most missense mutations cluster in the ATPase 
      domain, where they disrupt the protein's ability to sever microtubules. However, 
      several putative missense mutations in the protein's microtubule interacting and 
      trafficking (MIT) domain have also been described, but the pathogenicity of these 
      mutations has not been verified with functional studies. Spastin promotes endosomal 
      tubule fission, and defects in this lead to lysosomal enzyme mistrafficking and 
      downstream lysosomal abnormalities. We investigated the function of three 
      disease-associated spastin MIT mutants and found that none was able to promote 
      normal endosomal tubule fission, lysosomal enzyme receptor trafficking, or lysosomal 
      morphology. One of the mutations affected recruitment of spastin to endosomes, a 
      property that requires the canonical function of the MIT domain in binding endosomal 
      sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III proteins. However, the other 
      mutants did not affect spastin's endosomal recruitment, raising the possibility of 
      pathologically important non-canonical roles for the MIT domain. In conclusion, we 
      demonstrate that spastin MIT mutants cause functional abnormalities related to the 
      pathogenesis of HSP. These mutations do not directly affect spastin's 
      microtubule-severing capacity, and so we identify a new molecular pathological 
      mechanism by which spastin mutations may cause disease.

TI  - Mutations in PCYT2 disrupt etherlipid biosynthesis and cause a complex hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia.
PG  - 3382-3397
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz291 [doi]
AB  - CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ET), encoded by PCYT2, is the 
      rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine 
      pathway. Phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant membrane lipids and is 
      particularly enriched in the brain. We identified five individuals with biallelic 
      PCYT2 variants clinically characterized by global developmental delay with 
      regression, spastic para- or tetraparesis, epilepsy and progressive cerebral and 
      cerebellar atrophy. Using patient fibroblasts we demonstrated that these variants 
      are hypomorphic, result in altered but residual ET protein levels and concomitant 
      reduced enzyme activity without affecting mRNA levels. The significantly better 
      survival of hypomorphic CRISPR-Cas9 generated pcyt2 zebrafish knockout compared to a 
      complete knockout, in conjunction with previously described data on the Pcyt2 mouse 
      model, indicates that complete loss of ET function may be incompatible with life in 
      vertebrates. Lipidomic analysis revealed profound lipid abnormalities in patient 
      fibroblasts impacting both neutral etherlipid and etherphospholipid metabolism. 
      Plasma lipidomics studies also identified changes in etherlipids that have the 
      potential to be used as biomarkers for ET deficiency. In conclusion, our data 
      establish PCYT2 as a disease gene for a new complex hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      and confirm that etherlipid homeostasis is important for the development and 
      function of the brain.

TI  - VPS13D-related disorders presenting as a pure and complicated form of hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13 (VPS13) 
      family members including VPS13A, VPS13B, and VPS13C lead to chorea acanthocytosis, 
      Cohen syndrome, and parkinsonism, respectively. Recently, VPS13D mutations were 
      identified as a cause of VPS13D-related movement disorders, which show several 
      phenotypes including chorea, dystonia, spastic ataxia, and spastic paraplegia. 
      METHODS: We applied whole-exome analysis for a patient with a complicated form of 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and her unaffected parents. Then, we screened 
      the candidate genes in 664 Japanese families with HSP in Japan. RESULTS: We first 
      found a compound heterozygote VPS13D mutation and a heterozygote ABHD4 variation in 
      a sporadic patient with spastic paraplegia. Then, we found three patients with 
      VPS13D mutations in two Japanese HSP families. The three patients with homozygous 
      mutations (p.Thr1118Met/p.Thr1118Met and p.Thr2945Ala/p.Thr2945Ala) in the VPS13D 
      showed an adult onset pure form of HSP. Meanwhile, the patient with a compound 
      heterozygous mutation (p.Ser405Arg/p.Arg3141Ter) in the VPS13D showed a childhood 
      onset complicated form of HSP associated with cerebellar ataxia, cervical dystonia, 
      cataracts, and chorioretinal dystrophy. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we found 
      four patients in three Japanese families with novel VPS13D mutations, which may 
      broaden the clinical and genetic findings for VPS13D-related disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in CAPN1 have recently been reported to cause the spastic 
      paraplegia 76 (SPG76) subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). To investigate 
      the role of CAPN1 in spastic paraplegia and other neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD), and 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) we conducted a mutation analysis of CAPN1 in a 
      cohort of Chinese patients with SPG, SCA, EOPD, and ALS. METHODS: Variants of CAPN1 
      were detected in the three cohorts by Sanger or whole-exome sequencing, and all 
      exons and exon-intron boundaries of CAPN1 were analysed. RESULTS: A novel CAPN1 
      splicing variant (NM_001198868: c.338-1G > A) identified in a familial SPG/SCA 
      showed a complex phenotype, including spastic paraplegia, ataxia, and extensor 
      plantar response. This mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and completely 
      co-segregated with the phenotypes. Sequencing of the cDNA from the three affected 
      patients detected a guanine deletion (c.340_340delG) that was predicted to result in 
      an early stop codon after 61 amino acids (p. D114Tfs*62). No CAPN1 pathogenic 
      mutation was found in the EOPD or ALS groups. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a novel 
      CAPN1 mutation found in patients with SPG/SCA and emphasize the spastic and ataxic 
      phenotypes of SPG76, but CAPN1 may not play a major role in EOPD and ALS.

AB  - Ophthalmological abnormalities may occur in specific subtypes of hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP) and in genetic diseases that present with spastic paraplegia 
      mimicking HSP. These ophthalmological changes may precede the motor symptoms and 
      include pigmentary retinal degeneration, ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy, cataracts 
      and nystagmus. Some ophthalmological abnormalities are more prevalent in specific 
      forms of HSP. Considering that the diagnosis of HSP is usually difficult and 
      complex, specific ophthalmological changes may guide the genetic testing. There are 
      other genetic diseases such as autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of 
      Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and spastic paraplegia, 
      optic atrophy and neuropathy (SPOAN) that may mimic HSP and also may present with 
      specific ophthalmological changes. In this article, we review the main 
      ophthalmological changes observed in patients with HSP and HSP-like disorders.

AB  - Here, the pathogenesis of an IFIH1 gene mutation is discussed through the analysis 
      of a sporadic case of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Next-generation sequencing was 
      performed for the patient and his family members to detect mutations at the IFIH1 
      locus. The patient and his father were found to carry the same heterozygous missense 
      mutation (c.1093A > G; p.Gly495Arg), while the patient's mother does not carry this 
      mutation. This is the first report of this heterozygous IFIH1 mutation and it is 
      predicted to be disease-causing.

TI  - Autophagy in Myelinating Glia.
PG  - 256-266
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1066-19.2019 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is the cellular process involved in transportation and degradation of 
      membrane, proteins, pathogens, and organelles. This fundamental cellular process is 
      vital in development, plasticity, and response to disease and injury. Compared with 
      neurons, little information is available on autophagy in glia, but it is paramount 
      for glia to perform their critical responses to nervous system disease and injury, 
      including active tissue remodeling and phagocytosis. In myelinating glia, autophagy 
      has expanded roles, particularly in phagocytosis of mature myelin and in generating 
      the vast amounts of membrane proteins and lipids that must be transported to form 
      new myelin. Notably, autophagy plays important roles in removing excess cytoplasm to 
      promote myelin compaction and development of oligodendrocytes, as well as in 
      remyelination by Schwann cells after nerve trauma. This review summarizes the cell 
      biology of autophagy, detailing the major pathways and proteins involved, as well as 
      the roles of autophagy in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes in development, 
      plasticity, and diseases in which myelin is affected. This includes traumatic brain 
      injury, Alexander's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypoxia, multiple sclerosis, 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia, and others. Promising areas for future research are 
      highlighted.

AB  - Alterations of Ca(2+) homeostasis have been implicated in a wide range of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Ca(2+) efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum into the 
      cytoplasm is controlled by binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to its receptor. 
      Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are then rapidly degraded by the 
      endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Mutations in genes encoding 
      the neuronal isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR1) and genes 
      involved in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor degradation (ERLIN1, ERLIN2) are 
      known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and cerebellar ataxia. We provide 
      evidence that mutations in the ubiquitin E3 ligase gene RNF170, which targets 
      inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors for degradation, are the likely cause of 
      autosomal recessive HSP in four unrelated families and functionally evaluate the 
      consequences of mutations in patient fibroblasts, mutant SH-SY5Y cells and by gene 
      knockdown in zebrafish. Our findings highlight inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
      signaling as a candidate key pathway for hereditary spastic paraplegias and 
      cerebellar ataxias and thus prioritize this pathway for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of rare neurological disorders, 
      characterised by their extreme heterogeneity in both their clinical manifestations 
      and genetic origins. Although Charles-Prosper Ollivier d'Angers (1796-1845) sketched 
      out a suggestive description in 1827, it was Heinrich Erb (1840-1921) who described 
      the clinical picture, in 1875, for "spastic spinal paralysis". Jean-Martin Charcot 
      (1825-1893) began teaching the disorder as a clinical entity this same year. Adolf 
      von Strümpell (1853-1925) recognised its hereditary nature in 1880 and Maurice 
      Lorrain (1867-1956) gained posthumous fame for adding his name to that of Strümpell 
      and forming the eponym after his 1898 thesis, the first review covering twenty-nine 
      affected families. He benefited from the knowledge accumulated over a dozen years on 
      this pathology by his teacher, Fulgence Raymond (1844-1910). Here I present a 
      history across two centuries, leading to the clinical, anatomopathological, and 
      genetic description of hereditary spastic paraplegia which today enables a better 
      understanding of the causative cellular dysfunctions and makes it possible to 
      envisage effective treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a large group of degenerative, 
      neurological disorders characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and 
      weakness. The disease was investigated precisely but still clinicians often make 
      incorrect or late diagnosis. Our aim was to investigate the genetic background and 
      clinical phenotype of spastic paraplegia in large Polish family. CASE PRESENTATION: 
      A 37 years old woman presented with 4-year history of walking difficulties. On 
      neurological examination, she had signs of upper motor lesion in lower extremities. 
      She denied sphincter dysfunction and her cognition was normal. Her family history 
      was positive for individuals with gait problems. The initial diagnosis was familial 
      spastic paraplegia. Genetic testing identified a novel mutation in SPAST gene. All 
      available family members were examined and had genetic testing. The same mutation in 
      SPAST gene was identified in other affected family members. All patients caring the 
      mutation presented with different phenotypes. CONCLUSION: This study presents a 
      family with spastic paraplegia due to a novel mutation c.1390G›T(p.Glu464Term) in 
      SPAST gene. Affected individuals showed a range of phenotypes that varied in their 
      severity. This case report demonstrates, the signs of hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      can be often misdiagnosed with other diseases. Therefore genetic testing should 
      always be considered in patients with lower limb spasticity and positive family 
      history in order to help to establish the correct diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of 
      inherited disorders affecting predominantly the motor cortex and pyramidal tract, 
      which results in slowly progressing gait disorders, as well as spasticity and 
      weakness of lower extremities. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
      has been previously investigated as a therapeutic tool for similar motor deficits in 
      a number of neurologic conditions. The aim of this randomized, controlled trial was 
      to investigate the therapeutic potential of rTMS in various forms of HSP, including 
      pure and complicated forms, as well as adrenomyeloneuropathy. METHODS: We recruited 
      15 patients (five women and 10 men; mean age 43.7 ± 10.6 years) with the mentioned 
      forms of HSP. The intervention included five sessions of bilateral 10 Hz rTMS over 
      primary motor areas of the muscles of lower extremities and five sessions of similar 
      sham stimulation. RESULTS: One patient dropped out due to seizure, and 14 patients 
      completed the study protocol. After real stimulation, the strength of the proximal 
      and distal muscles of lower extremities increased, and the spasticity of the 
      proximal muscles decreased. Change in spasticity was still present during follow-up 
      assessment. No effect was observed regarding gait velocity. No changes were seen 
      after sham stimulation. A post hoc analysis revealed an inverse relation between 
      motor threshold and the change of the strength after active rTMS. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS 
      may have potential in improving weakness and spasticity of lower extremities in HSP, 
      especially of proximal muscles whose motor areas are located more superficially.

AB  - Mutations in the TANK binding kinase 1 gene (TBK1) are associated with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia; however, the range of clinical 
      phenotypes and neuropathological changes associated with these mutations have not 
      yet been completely elucidated. We present the detailed clinical, neuroimaging, and 
      neuropathological features of two brothers carrying the TBK1 p.Gly272_Thr331del 
      mutation. Both presented with very similar and unusual clinical features including 
      primary progressive aphasia and asymmetric-onset primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). 
      Repeated electrophysiological studies failed to reveal any lower motor neuron 
      involvement. Neuropathological evaluation of both cases revealed frontotemporal 
      lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy type B and selective involvement of 
      upper motor neurons with TDP-43 inclusions. The stereotypical clinical presentation 
      and neuropathological findings in these cases widen the phenotypic spectrum of TBK1 
      mutations and provide insights into the pathogenesis of PLS.

      paraplegia and neurodegeneration.

AB  - At the end of 19th century, Adolf von Strümpell and Sigmund Freud independently 
      described the symptoms of a new pathology now known as hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (HSP). HSP is part of the group of genetic neurodegenerative diseases usually 
      associated with slow progressive pyramidal syndrome, spasticity, weakness of the 
      lower limbs, and distal-end degeneration of motor neuron long axons. Patients are 
      typically characterized by gait symptoms (with or without other neurological 
      disorders), which can appear both in young and adult ages depending on the different 
      HSP forms. The disease prevalence is at 1.3-9.6 in 100 000 individuals in different 
      areas of the world, making HSP part of the group of rare neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Thus far, there are no specific clinical and paraclinical tests, and DNA analysis is 
      still the only strategy to obtain a certain diagnosis. For these reasons, it is 
      mandatory to extend the knowledge on genetic causes, pathology mechanism, and 
      disease progression to give clinicians more tools to obtain early diagnosis, better 
      therapeutic strategies, and examination tests. This review gives an overview of HSP 
      pathologies and general insights to a specific HSP subtype called spastic paraplegia 
      31 (SPG31), which rises after mutation of REEP1 gene. In fact, recent findings 
      discovered an interesting endoplasmic reticulum antistress function of REEP1 and a 
      role of this protein in preventing τ accumulation in animal models. For this reason, 
      this work tries to elucidate the main aspects of REEP1, which are described in the 
      literature, to better understand its role in SPG31 HSP and other pathologies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetic diseases 
      characterized by lower limb spasticity with or without additional neurological 
      features. Swallowing dysfunction is poorly studied in HSP and its presence can lead 
      to significant respiratory and nutritional complications. The aim of this study was 
      to evaluate the frequency and clinical characteristics of dysphagia in different 
      types of HSP. METHODS: A two-center cross-sectional prevalence study was performed. 
      Genetically confirmed HSP patients were evaluated using the Northwestern Dysphagia 
      Patient Check Sheet and the Functional Oral Intake Scale. In addition, 
      self-perception of dysphagia was assessed by the Eat Assessment Tool-10 and the 
      Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with spastic 
      paraplegia type 4 (SPG4), five with SPG11, four with SPG5, four with 
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), three with SPG7, and two with SPG3A were 
      evaluated. Mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia was present in 3/5 (60%) of 
      SPG11 and 2/4 (50%) of CTX patients. A single SPG4 (2%) and a single SPG7 (33%) 
      patient had mild oropharyngeal dysphagia. All other evaluated patients presented 
      with normal or functional swallowing. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant 
      oropharyngeal dysphagia was only present in complicated forms of HSP Patients with 
      SPG11 and CTX had the highest risks for dysphagia, suggesting that surveillance of 
      swallowing function should be part of the management of patients with these 
      disorders.

AB  - AIM: To investigate molecular, clinical and genealogical characteristics of SPG4 in 
      a first representative Russian group, to estimate SPG4 proportion among all 
      DNA-diagnosed spastic paraplegias. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty unrelated Russian 
      families with SPG4 detected in the course of clinical and molecular studies of 
      spastic paraplegias were studied. Clinical, genealogical and several molecular 
      methods were used, i.e. Sanger sequencing of SPAST, massive parallel sequencing MPS 
      (panel 'hereditary paraplegias') and multiplex ligation-dependent amplification 
      MLPA. RESULTS: SPG4 proportion was 56% among all DNA verified SPG cases (90 
      families/14 forms) and 68% in subgroup of dominant SPG. In 50 families, 43 different 
      SPAST mutations were detected, of which 21 were novel; percentage of large 
      rearrangements was 30% (13 mutations in 15 families). Four mutations were detected 
      in two families each, nonsense mutation c.1291C>T (p.Arg431*) in 4 unrelated 
      families. Proportion of familial cases was 68%, pedigrees with 'missing' disease in 
      elderly carriers pointed to incomplete penetrance. Age of onset varied from one year 
      to 58 years, middle-age onset was common but the proportion of early-onset cases, 
      particularly in male index cases, was also high. Onset age showed marked 
      intrafamilial differences (more than 10 years in 14 pedigrees, up to 50 year in one) 
      and between families with identical mutations. Insidious onset, slow development 
      with most patients ambulant and 'uncomplicated' phenotype were typical. Cases with 
      additional signs were: a family with ataxia in both patients, two families with 
      epilepsy in one of SPG4 patients; three families with mild mental deficiency in one 
      of SPG4 patients. A case described separately is a 29-year-old male patient with 
      indeterminate myalgia and no SPG signs in whom SPAST previously reported mutation 
      p.Ala430Thr de novo was an unexpected MPS finding. CONCLUSION: SPG4 substantially 
      predomimates in SPG structure in Russian families as practically everywhere else. 
      Half of 43 detected SPAST mutations are novel, the proportion of large 
      rearrangements is 30% higher than in most of studies. Clinical inter- and 
      intrafamilial variability concerns mostly age of onset. SPG4 is not exclusively 
      adult-onset as was thought earlier.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary lateral sclerosis is a progressive upper-motor-neuron disorder 
      associated with markedly longer survival than ALS. In contrast to ALS, the genetic 
      susceptibility, histopathological profile and imaging signature of PLS are poorly 
      characterised. Suspected PLS patients often face considerable diagnostic delay and 
      prognostic uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: To characterise the distinguishing clinical, 
      genetic and imaging features of PLS in contrast to ALS and healthy controls. 
      METHODS: A prospective population-based study was conducted with 49 PLS patients, 
      100 ALS patients and 100 healthy controls using genetic profiling, standardised 
      clinical assessments and neuroimaging. Whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses 
      were undertaken to evaluate patterns of grey and white matter degeneration. RESULTS: 
      In PLS, disease burden in the motor cortex is more medial than in ALS consistent 
      with its lower limb symptom-predominance. PLS is associated with considerable 
      cerebellar white and grey matter degeneration and the extra-motor profile of PLS 
      includes marked insular, inferior frontal and left pars opercularis pathology. 
      Contrary to ALS, PLS spares the postcentral gyrus. The body and splenium of the 
      corpus callosum are preferentially affected in PLS, in contrast to the genu 
      involvement observed in ALS. Clinical measures show anatomically meaningful 
      correlations with imaging metrics in a somatotopic distribution. PLS patients tested 
      negative for C9orf72 repeat expansions, known ALS and HSP-associated genes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric imaging in PLS highlights disease-specific motor and 
      extra-motor involvement distinct from ALS. In a condition where limited post-mortem 
      data are available, imaging offers invaluable pathological insights. Anatomical 
      correlations with clinical metrics confirm the biomarker potential of quantitative 
      neuroimaging in PLS.

TI  - Longitudinal analysis of sniff nasal inspiratory pressure assessed using occluded 
      and un-occluded measurement techniques in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary 
      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 481-489
LID - 10.1080/21678421.2019.1639194 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) is a commonly used clinical 
      measure of respiratory impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is 
      used to guide the initiation of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). SNIP can be completed 
      with either an occluded or an un-occluded contralateral nostril. The aim of this 
      study was to compare occluded and un-occluded SNIP measurements and to examine the 
      decline in occluded SNIP over time compared to the ALSFRS-R respiratory subscore. 
      Methods: This was a prospective longitudinal study examining occluded and 
      un-occluded SNIP scores in ALS and PLS patients recorded between 2001 and 2018. 
      Bland and Altman graphs were plotted for occluded vs. un-occluded SNIP measurements 
      taking account of the repeated measures nature of the data. Longitudinal models were 
      constructed as linear mixed effects multi-level models with follow-up in ALS limited 
      to 6 years. Results: SNIP measured with an occluded contralateral nostril was 
      systematically higher than with an un-occluded nostril. SNIP measured using both 
      methods declined non-linearly, particularly after 2-3 years. The best fit model for 
      decline in occluded SNIP included a main effect and interaction between site of 
      onset and time, with age and diagnostic delay as independent variables. This showed 
      a linear decline in spinal onset with a floor effect in bulbar-onset ALS. 
      Conclusion: SNIP measured with an occluded and un-occluded contralateral nostril is 
      not interchangeable, which is relevant in interpreting thresholds for initiation of 
      NIV. SNIP declines non-linearly, which is explained in spinal onset ALS by age and 
      diagnostic delay, but an apparent floor effect remains in bulbar onset.

TI  - Clinical and genetic analysis of ATP13A2 in hereditary spastic paraplegia expands 
      the phenotype.
PG  - e1052
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1052 [doi]
LID - e1052
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are neurodegenerative disorders 
      characterized by lower limb spasticity and weakness, with or without additional 
      symptoms. Mutations in ATP13A2, known to cause Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS), have been 
      recently implicated in HSP. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was done in a 
      Canada-wide HSP cohort. RESULTS: Three additional patients with homozygous ATP13A2 
      mutations were identified, representing 0.7% of all HSP families. Spastic paraplegia 
      was the predominant feature, all patients suffered from psychiatric symptoms, and 
      one patient had developed seizures. Of the identified mutations, 
      c.2126G>C;(p.[Arg709Thr]) is novel, c.2158G>T;(p.[Gly720Trp]) has not been reported 
      in ATP13A2-related diseases, and c.2473_2474insAAdelC;p.[Leu825Asnfs*32]) has been 
      previously reported in KRS but not in HSP. Structural analysis of the mutations 
      suggested a disruptive effect, and enrichment analysis suggested the potential 
      involvement of specific pathways. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that in HSP 
      patients with psychiatric symptoms, ATP13A2 mutations should be suspected, 
      especially if they also have extrapyramidal symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a low incidence motor neuron disease 
      which carries a markedly better prognosis than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      Despite sporadic reports of extra-motor symptoms, PLS is widely regarded as a pure 
      upper motor neuron disorder. The post mortem literature of PLS is strikingly sparse 
      and very little is known of subcortical grey matter pathology in this condition. 
      METHODS: A prospective imaging study was undertaken with 33 PLS patients, 117 
      healthy controls and 100 ALS patients to specifically assess the integrity of 
      subcortical grey matter structures and determine whether PLS and ALS have divergent 
      thalamic, hippocampal and basal ganglia signatures. Volumetric, morphometric, 
      segmentation and vertex-wise analyses were carried out in the three study groups to 
      evaluate the integrity of thalamus, hippocampus, caudate, amygdala, pallidum, 
      putamen and accumbens nucleus in each hemisphere. The hippocampus was further 
      parcellated to characterise the involvement of specific subfields. RESULTS: 
      Considerable thalamic, caudate, and hippocampal atrophy was detected in PLS based on 
      both volumetric and vertex analyses. Significant volume reductions were also 
      detected in the accumbens nuclei. Hippocampal atrophy in PLS was dominated by 
      dentate gyrus, hippocampal tail and CA4 subfield volume reductions. The morphometric 
      comparison of ALS and PLS cohorts revealed preferential medial bi-thalamic pathology 
      in PLS compared to the predominant putaminal degeneration detected in ALS. Another 
      distinguishing feature between ALS and PLS was the preferential atrophy of the 
      amygdala in ALS. CONCLUSIONS: PLS is associated with considerable subcortical grey 
      matter degeneration and due to the extensive extra-motor involvement, it should no 
      longer be regarded a pure upper motor neuron disorder. Given its unique pathological 
      features and a clinical course which differs considerably from ALS, dedicated 
      research studies and disease-specific therapeutic strategies are urgently required 
      in PLS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of neurogenetic 
      disorders seen mainly in adults. With the advancement in genetics, more than 78 
      types of HSP have been identified, with increasing identification of HSP in 
      children. However, there is scant literature on this from India. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with HSP diagnosed in the last 6 
      years was done. The data were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 11 
      patients had a diagnosis of HSP (genetically confirmed), with mean age of 
      presentation at 21.7 months. The main symptom at the time of presentation was 
      delayed walking and/or abnormal gait in the form of tip-toeing and scissoring of 
      limbs. The mean delay in diagnosis was 5.2 years after initial presentation. MRI of 
      the presented children showed mainly thinning of corpus callosum and white-matter 
      changes. All of them had gradual worsening spasticity, despite physiotherapy and 
      drugs. Except one, all children had recessive form of spastic paraplegia. Child with 
      autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia had heterozygous mutation in SPAST gene, which 
      is known to present in the first 2 years of life. CONCLUSIONS: HSP is probably not 
      uncommon. Recessive form of HSP is more frequently seen in children. Because of lack 
      of awareness, there is delay in reaching the final diagnosis.

TI  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a novel phenotype for germline de novo ATP1A1 
      mutation.
PG  - 521-526
LID - 10.1111/cge.13668 [doi]
AB  - Dominant mutations in ATP1A1, encoding the alpha-1 isoform of the Na(+) /K(+) 
      -ATPase, have been recently reported to cause an axonal to intermediate type of 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (ie, CMT2DD) and a syndrome with hypomagnesemia, 
      intractable seizures and severe intellectual disability. Here, we describe the first 
      case of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) caused by a novel de novo (p.L337P) 
      variant in ATP1A1. We provide evidence for the causative role of this variant with 
      functional and homology modeling studies. This finding expands the phenotypic 
      spectrum of the ATP1A1-related disorders, adds a piece to the larger genetic puzzle 
      of HSP, and increases knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited 
      axonopathies (ie, CMT and HSP).

AB  - Proper intracellular trafficking is essential for neuronal development and function, 
      and when any aspect of this process is dysregulated, the resulting "transportopathy" 
      causes neurological disorders. Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a family of 
      such diseases attributed to over 80 spastic gait genes (SPG), specifically 
      characterized by lower extremity spasticity and weakness. Multiple genes in the 
      trafficking pathway such as those relating to microtubule structure and function and 
      organelle biogenesis are representative disease loci. Microtubule motor proteins, or 
      kinesins, are also causal in HSP, specifically mutations in Kinesin-I/KIF5A (SPG10) 
      and two kinesin-3 family members; KIF1A (SPG30) and KIF1C (SPG58). KIF1A is a motor 
      enriched in neurons, and involved in the anterograde transport of a variety of 
      vesicles that contribute to pre- and post-synaptic assembly, autophagic processes, 
      and neuron survival. KIF1C is ubiquitously expressed and, in addition to anterograde 
      cargo transport, also functions in retrograde transport between the Golgi and the 
      endoplasmic reticulum. Only a handful of KIF1C cargos have been identified; however, 
      many have crucial roles such as neuronal differentiation, outgrowth, plasticity and 
      survival. HSP-related kinesin-3 mutants are characterized mainly as loss-of-function 
      resulting in deficits in motility, regulation, and cargo binding. Gain-of-function 
      mutants are also seen, and are characterized by increased microtubule-on rates and 
      hypermotility. Both sets of mutations ultimately result in misdelivery of critical 
      cargos within the neuron. This likely leads to deleterious cell biological cascades 
      that likely underlie or contribute to HSP clinical pathology and ultimately, 
      symptomology. Due to the paucity of histopathological or cell biological data 
      assessing perturbations in cargo localization, it has been difficult to positively 
      link these mutations to the outcomes seen in HSPs. Ultimately, the goal of this 
      review is to encourage future academic and clinical efforts to focus on 
      "transportopathies" through a cargo-centric lens.

TI  - Spastic Paraplegia 8.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 (SPG8) is a slowly 
      progressive pure spastic paraplegia of the lower limbs (i.e., pyramidal signs 
      including hyperreflexia, spasticity, and occasionally clonus without other 
      neurologic findings). Some affected individuals have urinary urgency that usually 
      becomes apparent at the same time as the spasticity. Onset is between ages ten and 
      59 years. Affected individuals often become wheelchair dependent. While intra- and 
      interfamilial phenotypic variability is high, SPG8 is typically more severe than 
      other types of hereditary spastic paraplegia. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of 
      SPG8 is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a 
      heterozygous pathogenic variant in WASHC5 identified by molecular genetic testing. 
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: A multidisciplinary approach to management 
      of spasticity is recommended including neurology, physical therapy (PT), 
      occupational therapy (OT), urology, speech and language pathology, feeding team, 
      psychiatry/mental health, and social work. Surveillance: Regular neurologic 
      examinations to evaluate disease progression and response to treatment; urologist 
      for assessment of bladder function and risk for urinary tract infection; PT/OT to 
      assess mobility and activities of daily living; feeding team for nutrition and risk 
      for aspiration; speech and language pathologist re dysarthria; and mental health 
      clinician re depression. GENETIC COUNSELING: SPG8 is inherited in an autosomal 
      dominant manner. More than 90% of individuals with SPG8 have an affected parent. 
      Each child of an individual with SPG8 has a 50% chance of inheriting the WASHC5 
      pathogenic variant. Once the WASHC5 pathogenic variant has been identified in an 
      affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and 
      preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

AB  - Introduction: In-vivo objective documentation of pathological changes in 
      neurodegenerative disease is a major aim to possibly improve our ability to monitor 
      disease progression and response to treatment. Temporal thinning of the retinal 
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness shown by spectral domain optical coherence 
      tomography (SD-OCT) has been reported in association with the complex forms in 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We performed an assessment of the RNFL 
      thickness in a group of HSP patients, including a longitudinal follow-up in a 
      subgroup. Our aim was to measure and compare the changes and correlate them to 
      clinical progression. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three HSP patients were 
      recruited and studied with the SD-OCT including papillary and macular scan by 
      Spectralis. The clinical severity was assessed using the Spastic Paraplegia Rating 
      Scale. Results: Thinning of the superior, nasal and inferior quadrants bilaterally 
      were observed compared to the normative data in both pure and complicated forms, 
      that were clearly pathological only in a proportion of cases. Thinning correlated 
      with age and disease duration, but not with clinical severity. The longitudinal 
      study (n = 9) showed no significant change compared to the baseline data for the 
      period of observation (mean 10.7 months). Conclusions: RFNL is frequently thinned in 
      HSP with no specific recognizable pattern of quadrants involved and SPG types. The 
      small sample size and the short follow-up time showed no clear progression. Although 
      SD-OCT appraisal of RFNL deserves to be explored in neurodegenerative conditions, it 
      might not be suitable for use as a biomarker in HSP as it appears not to be specific 
      to this condition and can be a feature of aging.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia as the predominant phenotype in a cohort of Chinese patients with 
      adrenoleukodystrophy.
PG  - e1065
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1065 [doi]
LID - e1065
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of the most common 
      peroxisomal disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of very long-chain 
      fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and tissues and caused by mutations within ABCD1. 
      Clinically, ALD present with various phenotypes, ranging from asymptomatic type to 
      rapidly progressive childhood cerebral form. However, no remarkable abnormality in 
      cerebral white matter usually makes it difficult to distinguish adult ALD from 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). METHODS: We analyzed the features of seven 
      Chinese ALD patients who had a primary phenotype of spastic paraplegia. Sequencing 
      was performed in the probands and their familial members. Detailed clinical, VLCFAs 
      test, hormone test, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyogram are presented. 
      RESULTS: We reported seven ALD patients from a Chinese cohort of 142 HSP patients. 
      Genetic investigations revealed five known ABCD1 mutations (c.346G>C, c.521A>G, 
      c.829G>T, c.1415_1416delAG, and c.1849C>T) and two novel mutations (c.454C>G, 
      c.1452_1482del). Further auxiliary testing revealed that they had higher VLCFA 
      and/or adrenal insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the mutation spectrum 
      of ABCD1 and indicate that ALD represent a significant portion (4.9%, 7/142) of the 
      spastic paraplegia entities. ALD should be considered in male patients with spastic 
      paraplegia, even if there was no positive family history.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many causative genes of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) 
      have been uncovered in recent years, there are still approximately 50% of HSP 
      patients without genetically diagnosis, especially in autosomal recessive (AR) HSP 
      patients. Rare studies have been performed to determine the genetic spectrum and 
      clinical profiles of recessive HSP patients in the Chinese population. METHODS: In 
      this study, we investigated 24 Chinese index AR/sporadic patients by targeted 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent 
      probe amplification (MLPA). Further functional studies were performed to identify 
      pathogenicity of those uncertain significance variants. RESULTS: We identified 11 
      mutations in HSP related genes including 7 novel mutations, including two 
      (p.V1979_L1980delinsX, p.F2343 fs) in SPG11, two (p.T55 M, p.S308 T) in AP5Z1, one 
      (p.S242 N) in ALDH18A1, one (p.D597fs) in GBA2, and one (p.Q486X) in ATP13A2 in 8 
      index patients and their family members. Mutations in ALDH18A1, AP5Z1, CAPN1 and 
      ATP13A2 genes were firstly reported in the Chinese population. Furthermore, the 
      clinical phenotypes of the patients carrying mutations were described in detail. The 
      mutation (p.S242 N) in ALDH18A1 decreased enzyme activity of P5CS and mutations 
      (p.T55 M, p.S308 T) in AP5Z1 induced lysosomal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      expanded the genetic spectrum and clinical profiles of AR-HSP patients and further 
      demonstrated the efficiency and reliability of targeted NGS diagnosing suspected HSP 
      patients.

AB  - SPG11 mutations lead to heterogeneous neurological phenotypes, but metabolic 
      abnormalities have not yet been explored in this disease. In this study, we 
      investigate whether SPG11 pathogenic variants might affect metabolic regulation, 
      leading to weight changes and if this could relate to hypothalamic damage. In this 
      cross-sectional case-control study, we selected a group of individuals with 
      confirmed SPG11 mutations (n = 20), paired with healthy controls - both groups 
      underwent brain MRI, from which we performed manual hypothalamic segmentation - and 
      patients with Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA), having collected weight and height data for 
      BMI-comparison. In the SPG11 group, we found significantly higher BMI compared to 
      FRDA (p = .034), as well as hypothalamic atrophy compared to controls (p = .030). 
      Volumetric changes were not associated with BMI, age, disease duration or SPRS 
      amongst subjects with SPG11. Therefore, this study presents a new feature in SPG11 
      by characterizing a higher obesity rate in these patients, that could be associated 
      with the hypothalamic atrophy found in this population.

TI  - A case of spastic paraplegia-15 with a novel pathogenic variant in ZFYVE26 gene.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. It has autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal 
      recessive (AR) and X-linked forms. HSPs are clinically classified into 'pure' and 
      'complicated' (complex) forms. SPG11 (KIAA1840) and SPG15 (ZFYVE26) are the most 
      common ARHSPs with thin corpus callosum (TCC). They typically present with early 
      cognitive impairment in childhood followed by gait impairment and spasticity in the 
      second and third decades of life. Here, we present a patient girl, born to a couple 
      who were first cousins, was admitted to the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic at 
      14 years of age because of walking with help, dysarthria and forgetfulness. Her 
      examination revealed a motor mental retardation, bilateral leg spasticity, increased 
      deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs, bilateral pigmentary retinopathy; TCC and white 
      matter hyperintensities on brain MRI, sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy findings in 
      lower limbs on electromyography. Based on the clinical features and the imaging 
      studies, the diagnosis of HSP was suspected. Targeted next generation sequencing 
      (NGS) was performed using Inherited NGS Panel that consists of 579 gene associated 
      with Mendelian disorders. Analysis of the patient revealed a 
      c.6398_6401delGGGA(p.Arg2133Asnfs*15)(Exon35) homozygous novel change in ZFYVE26 
      gene. Genotype-phenotype correlation of HSP is complicated due to heterogeneity. The 
      clinical similarity of HSP types increases the importance of genetic diagnosis. 
      There are few reports about pathogenic variants in ZFYVE26 gene in the literature. 
      This case report is one of the few studies that revealed a novel pathogenic variant 
      in ZFYVE26 gene using NGS.

TI  - Treatable cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia: eight cases of combined 
      homocysteinaemia with methylmalonic aciduria.
PG  - 2434-2439
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09432-8 [doi]
AB  - Combined homocysteinemia with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA/HCY) are genetic disorders 
      of intracellular cobalamin (cbl) transport and processing that cause downstream 
      deficiencies in methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Untreated disease is 
      characterized biochemically by methylmalonic aciduria and hyperhomocysteinemia, 
      while the clinical features are variable. When spastic paraplegia (SP) dominates, it 
      is difficult to differentiate from hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Clinical, 
      biochemical and imaging features were reviewed in eight patients with MMA/HCY that 
      mimicked HSP. Seven males and one female were enrolled. The median onset age was 
      13 years old (range 7-26 years old). The median time delay of diagnosis was 
      20.5 months (range 2-60 months). Spastic gait was the first symptom in four 
      patients, while the other four patients presented with chronic emotional 
      abnormalities or cognitive impairment. The main clinical manifestation was SP, and 
      other neurological symptoms included cognitive impairment (5/8), spastic dysuria 
      (3/8), personality change and depression (3/8), ataxia (2/8), seizures (2/8), limb 
      numbness (2/8), and developmental delay (2/8). When patients were diagnosed, the 
      mean serum homocysteine level, the methylmalonic acid level in urine, the serum 
      propionylcarnitine (C(3)) level and the ratios of C(3)-to-acetylcarnitine (C(2)) and 
      free carnitine (C(0)) were all dramatically elevated. Cranial MRIs showed nothing 
      remarkable except mild brain atrophy. All spinal MRIs were normal except for case 8. 
      Definite compound heterozygous mutations in MMACHC were detected in five cases. 
      Follow-up indicated partial improvement in all the patients after intramuscular cbl, 
      oral betaine and folate, supporting the diagnosis of MMA/HCY. Our data highlight the 
      need for extensive investigation of intracellular cbl transport and processing, when 
      spastic paraparesis is a prominent component of the clinical picture. Testing for 
      urine methylmalonic acid and serum homocysteine levels is a simple but critical 
      approach in suspected cases. Genetic testing, especially for MMACHC gene mutations, 
      is needed. Raising awareness of this disorder could result in the timely initiation 
      of targeted treatment, which may significantly improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common debilitating neurodegenerative disease caused 
      by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra within the central nervous 
      system (CNS). The process leading to this neuronal loss is poorly understood. 
      Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common benign inflammatory condition of the skin 
      which mainly affects lipid-rich regions of the head and trunk. SD is caused by over 
      proliferation of the lipophilic fungus Malassezia. PD and SD are strongly 
      associated. The increased PD risk following an SD diagnosis (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.36, 
      2.1; p < 0.001) reported by Tanner and colleagues remains unexplained. Malassezia 
      were historically considered commensals confined to the skin. However, many recent 
      studies report finding Malassezia in internal organs, including the CNS. This raises 
      the possibility that Malassezia might be directly contributing to PD. Several lines 
      of evidence support this hypothesis. AIDS is causally associated with both 
      parkinsonism and SD, suggesting that weak T cell-mediated control of commensal 
      microbes such as Malassezia might contribute to both. Genetic polymorphisms 
      associated with PD (LRRK2, GBA, PINK1, SPG11, SNCA) increase availability of lipids 
      within human cells, providing a suitable environment for Malassezia. Four LRRK2 
      polymorphisms which increase PD risk also increase Crohn's disease risk; Crohn's 
      disease is strongly associated with an immune response against fungi, particularly 
      Malassezia. Finally, Malassezia hypha formation and melanin synthesis are stimulated 
      by L-DOPA, which could promote Malassezia invasiveness of dopamine neurons, and 
      contribute to the accumulation of melanin in these neurons. Although Malassezia's 
      presence in the substantia nigra remains to be confirmed, if Malassezia play a role 
      in PD etiology, antifungal drugs should be tested as a possible therapeutic 
      intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spastic paraplegia type 11 (SPG11) mutations are the most frequent cause 
      of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (ARHSP). We are aiming to 
      identify the causative mutations in SPG11 among families referred to our center with 
      ARHSP in a Chinese population. METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing was 
      performed on the patients to identify disease-causing mutations. Variants were 
      analyzed according to their predicted pathogenicity and their relevance to the 
      clinical phenotypes. The segregation in the family members was validated by Sanger 
      sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 12 mutations in SPG11 gene from 9 index cases were 
      identified, including 6 frameshift mutations, 3 missense mutations, 1 nonsense 
      mutation, 1 splicing mutation, and 1 intron deletion mutation. In 6 of these 
      patients, the mutations were homozygous, and the other 3 patients carried two 
      compound heterozygous mutations. Six mutations were novel; 2 were classified as 
      pathogenic, 1 were considered as likely pathogenic, and the other 3 were variants of 
      unknown significance. Additionally, 1 missense heterozygous variant we found was 
      also carried by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Clinically and 
      electrophysiologically, some of our ARHSP patients partially shared various features 
      of autosomal-recessive juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ARJALS), including 
      combination of both UMN and LMN degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: The results contribute to 
      extending of the SPG11 gene mutation spectrum and emphasizing a putative link 
      between ARHSP and ARJALS.

LID - 10.1126/scisignal.aau7500 [doi]
LID - eaau7500
AB  - Mutations in WASHC5 (also known as KIAA0196) cause autosomal dominant hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP) type SPG8. WASHC5, commonly called strumpellin, is a core 
      component of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex 
      that activates actin nucleation at endosomes. Although various other cellular roles 
      for strumpellin have also been described, none account for how SPG8-associated 
      mutations lead to HSP. Here, we identified protein interactors of the WASH complex 
      by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry and assessed the functions of 
      strumpellin in cultured cells using both overexpression and RNA interference along 
      with cell-spreading assays to investigate cell adhesion. We uncovered a decrease in 
      CAV1 protein abundance as well as endosomal fission defects resulting from 
      pathogenic SPG8 mutations. CAV1, a key component of caveolae, interacted with 
      strumpellin in cells, and strumpellin inhibited the lysosomal degradation of CAV1. 
      SPG8-associated missense mutations in strumpellin did not rescue endosomal 
      tubulation defects, reduction in CAV1 protein abundance, or integrin-mediated cell 
      adhesion in strumpellin-deficient cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the 
      WASH complex maintained CAV1 and integrin protein amounts by inhibiting their 
      lysosomal degradation through its endosomal actin nucleation activity. In addition, 
      the interaction of strumpellin with CAV1 stimulated integrin recycling, thereby 
      promoting cell adhesion. These findings provide a molecular link between WASHC5 
      mutations and impairment of CAV1- and integrin-mediated cell adhesion, providing 
      insights into the cellular pathogenesis of SPG8.

      Regulates 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase 1 Directions in Rat Leydig Cells.
PG  - 886

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate cytochrome P450-7B1 
      (CYP7B1) in the human and rat testes to regulate 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 
      (11β-HSD1) activity. We hypothesized that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its 
      product 7α-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone (7αOHD) after catalysis of CYP7B1 played a 
      critical role in driving the direction of 11β-HSD1, because 7αOHD is an alternative 
      substrate for 11β-HSD1. Methods: We examined the influence of DHEA and 7αOHD on 
      11β-HSD1 activities in both intact Leydig cells and microsomes using radioactive 
      substrates and identified the location of CYP7B1 in Leydig cells using 
      immunohistochemical staining, Western blot, and qPCR. Results: We found that DHEA 
      stimulated 11β-HSD1 oxidase activity in intact cells (EC(50) = 0.97 ± 0.11 μM) and 
      inhibited its reductase activity (IC(50) = 1.04 ± 0.06 μM). In microsomes, DHEA was 
      a competitive inhibitor of the reductase activity. The 11β-HSD1 oxidase activity in 
      intact cells was inhibited by 7αOHD (IC(50) = 1.18 ± 0.12 μM), and the reductase 
      activity was enhanced (EC(50) = 0.7 ± 0.04 μM). 7αOHD was a competitive inhibitor of 
      11β-HSD1 oxidase. CYP7B1 was present in rat Leydig cells, as shown by 
      immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and qPCR analysis. Conclusion: Our results 
      are consistent with a conclusion that DHEA in the circulation driving 11β-HSD1 
      toward an oxidase in Leydig cells mainly through inhibiting the reductase of the 
      enzyme, while 7αOHD (CYP7B1 catalytic product of DHEA) drives the enzyme toward the 
      opposite direction.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the cognitive profile of Hereditary Spastic 
      Paraplegias (HSP), where most scientific attention has been given to motor features 
      related to corticospinal tract degeneration. Objectives: We aimed to perform a broad 
      characterization of the cognitive functions of patients with pure and complicated 
      HSP as well as to determine the frequency of abnormal cognitive performances in the 
      studied subtypes. Methods: A two-center cross-sectional case-control study was 
      performed. All individuals underwent cognitive assessment through screening tests 
      (Mini Mental State Examination-MEEM and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MOCA) and 
      tests to assess specific cognitive functions (Verbal fluency with phonological 
      restriction-FAS; Verbal categorical fluency-FAS-cat and Rey's Verbal Auditory 
      Learning Test -RAVLT). Results: Fifty four patients with genetically confirmed HSP 
      diagnosis, 36 with spastic paraplegia type 4 (SPG4), 5 SPG11, 4 SPG5, 4 
      cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), 3 SPG7 and 2 SPG3A, and 10 healthy, unrelated 
      control subjects, with similar age, sex, and education participated in the study. 
      SPG4 patients had worse performances in MOCA, FAS, FAS-cat, and RAVLT when compared 
      to controls. Most SPG4 patients presented cognitive changes not compatible with 
      dementia, performing poorly in memory, attention and executive functions. SPG5 
      patients scored lower in executive functions and memory, and SPG7 patients performed 
      poorly on memory tasks. All evaluated cognitive functions were markedly altered in 
      CTX and SPG11 patients. Conclusions: Cognitive abnormalities are frequent in HSP, 
      being more severe in complicated forms. However, cognitive impairments of pure HSPs 
      might impact patients' lives, decreasing families' socioeconomic status and 
      contributing to the overall disease burden.

AB  - In the health domain, well-being is primarily assessed as autonomy and mental 
      distress, whereas the quality of daily experience is rarely investigated. In this 
      study, the relationship between autonomy levels and daily experience was explored. 
      Thirty-five Italian adults with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia provided for one week 
      real-time descriptions of daily activities and associated experiences through the 
      Experience Sampling Method procedure. Participants were grouped based on autonomy 
      levels assessed through Barthel Index. The relationships between activity 
      typologies, the experiential dimensions, perceived challenges and skills, and 
      autonomy level were analysed. Participants' predominant activities were personal 
      care, associated with global disengagement, and leisure, associated with high 
      control and desirability, but low perceived relevance. During social interactions 
      participants reported engagement and emotional well-being, and during productive 
      activities high activation but negative affect. Multi-level analysis highlighted 
      that this association between activity type and experiential patterns recurred 
      across autonomy levels. In addition, perceived challenges in the activity were lower 
      that perceived personal skills across activities and autonomy levels. Findings 
      suggest that persons with motor disabilities, regardless of their autonomy level, 
      would benefit from more challenging opportunities for action in daily life, in order 
      to attain well-being through active skill mobilisation.

AB  - Many sex differences in liver gene expression originate in the brain, depend on GH 
      secretion and may underlie sex disparities in hepatic disease. Because epigenetic 
      mechanisms may contribute, we studied promoter methylation and microRNA abundance in 
      the liver, associated with expression of sexual dimorphic genes in mice with 
      selective disruption of the dopamine D2 receptor in neurons (neuroDrd2KO), which 
      decreases hypothalamic Ghrh, pituitary GH, and serum IGFI and in neonatally 
      androgenized female mice which have increased pituitary GH content and serum IGFI. 
      We evaluated mRNA levels of the female predominant genes prolactin receptor (Prlr), 
      alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1), Cyp2a4, and hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor 
      6 (Hnf6) and the male predominant gene, Cyp7b1. Female predominant genes had higher 
      mRNA levels compared to males, but lower methylation was only detected in the Prlr 
      and Cyp2a4 female promoters. In neuroDrd2KO mice, sexual dimorphism was lost for all 
      genes; the upregulation (feminization) of Prlr and Cyp2a4 in males correlated with 
      decreased methylation of their promoters, and the downregulation (masculinization) 
      of Hnf-6 mRNA in females correlated inversely with its promoter methylation. 
      Neonatal androgenization of females evoked a loss of sexual dimorphism only for the 
      female predominant Hnf6 and Adh1 genes, but no differences in promoter methylation 
      were found. Finally, mmu-miR-155-5p, predicted to target Cyp7b1 expression, was 
      lower in males in association with higher Cyp7b1 mRNA levels compared to females and 
      was not modified in neuroDrd2KO or TP mice. Our results suggest specific regulation 
      of gene sexually dimorphic expression in the liver by methylation or miRNAs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our research aim was to develop a novel clinimetric scale sensitive 
      enough to detect disease progression in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). METHODS: A 
      prototype of the PLS Functional Rating Scale (PLSFRS) was generated. Seventy-seven 
      participants with PLS were enrolled and evaluated at 21 sites that comprised the 
      PLSFRS study group. Participants were assessed using the PLSFRS, Neuro-Quality of 
      Life (QoL), Schwab-England Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and the Clinical Global 
      Impression of Change scales. Participants completed telephone assessments at 12, 24, 
      and 48 weeks after enrollment. RESULTS: The PLSFRS demonstrated internal consistency 
      as well as intrarater, interrater, telephone test-retest reliability, and construct 
      validity. Significant changes in disease progression were detected at 6 and 
      12 months; changes measured by the PLSFRS vs the ALSFRS-R were significantly higher. 
      DISCUSSION: The PLSFRS is a valid tool to assess the natural history of PLS in a 
      shorter study period.

LID - 7615605
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a rare 
      group of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spasticity with or 
      without other symptoms. SPG11 gene is the most common cause of autosomal recessive 
      HSP. We report a case of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 76 due to 
      heterozygous variants of CAPN1 in an Argentinean subject. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      38-year-old Argentinean female presented with progressive gait problems and 
      instability of 15-year duration. Oculomotor abnormalities, ataxia, bradykinesia, 
      cervical dystonia, and lower limb pyramidal signs were observed. Brain MRI was 
      unremarkable. Whole-exome sequencing analysis identified two heterozygous variants 
      in CAPN1. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should screen for CAPN1 mutation in a young female 
      patient without significant family history with a spastic paraplegia syndrome 
      associated with other symptoms.

TI  - Spastic Paraplegia 3A.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A; also known as ATL1-HSP) is 
      characterized by progressive bilateral and mostly symmetric spasticity and weakness 
      of the legs. Compared to other forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP), in which diminished vibration sense (caused by degeneration of the 
      corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns) and urinary bladder hyperactivity are 
      present in all affected individuals, these findings occur in a minority of 
      individuals with SPG3A. The average age of onset is four years. More than 80% of 
      reported individuals manifest spastic gait before the end of the first decade of 
      life. Most persons with early-onset ATL1-HSP have a "pure" ("uncomplicated") HSP; 
      however, complicated HSP with axonal motor neuropathy and/or distal amyotrophy with 
      lower motor neuron involvement (Silver syndrome phenotype) have been observed. The 
      rate of progression in ATL1-HSP is slow, and wheelchair dependency or need for a 
      walking aid (cane, walker, or wheelchair) is relatively rare. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The 
      diagnosis of ATL1-HSP is established in a proband with suggestive findings and 
      almost exclusively a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATL1 identified by molecular 
      genetic testing. Note: The exceptions are two families with biallelic ATL1 
      pathogenic variants. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is 
      symptomatic. Medical treatment of spasticity may begin with oral baclofen or 
      tizanidine, followed by chemodenervation with botulinum A or B toxins if oral 
      antispasticity medications are not tolerated. Intrathecal baclofen pump may be 
      considered for those who improve on oral baclofen but have significant systemic 
      adverse effects. Medical therapy should be combined with intensive physical therapy 
      focused on stretching and strengthening exercises that may help delay or minimize 
      muscle tendon contractures, scoliosis, and foot deformities. Distal weakness 
      (typically affecting foot dorsiflexion) can be ameliorated by ankle-foot orthoses. 
      Urinary urgency can be treated with anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs. 
      Surveillance: No consensus exists regarding the frequency of clinical follow-up 
      visits, but reevaluation once or twice yearly to identify and treat new 
      complications is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dantrolene, as it can 
      induce irreversible weakness, adversely affecting mobility. GENETIC COUNSELING: 
      ATL1-HSP is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More than 
      95% of individuals diagnosed with SPG3A have an affected parent; the proportion of 
      individuals with ATL1-HSP caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is currently 
      unknown. Each child of an individual with ATL1-HSP has a 50% chance of inheriting 
      the pathogenic variant. Once the ATL1 pathogenic variant has been identified in a 
      family member with autosomal dominant ATL1-HSP, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at 
      increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

TI  - Mobility Characteristics of Children with Spastic Paraplegia Due to a Mutation in 
      the KIF1A Gene.
PG  - 146-153
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-3400988 [doi]
AB  - Several de novo variants in the KIF1A gene have been reported to cause a complicated 
      form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. Additional symptoms include cognitive 
      impairment and varying degrees of peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, decreased visual 
      acuity, and ataxia. We describe four patients (ages 10-18 years), focusing on their 
      mobility and gait characteristics. Two patients were not able to walk without 
      assistance and showed a severe abnormal gait pattern, crouch gait. At examination, 
      severe contractures were found.In addition to describing the different phenotypes 
      with specific attention to gait in our cases, we reviewed known KIF1A mutations and 
      summarized their associated phenotypes.We conclude that mobility and cognition are 
      severely affected in children with spastic paraplegia due to de novo KIF1A 
      mutations. Deterioration in mobility is most likely due to progressive spasticity, 
      muscle weakness, and the secondary development of severe contractures, possibly 
      combined with an additional progressive polyneuropathy. Close follow-up and 
      treatment of these patients are warranted.

TI  - Adaptor protein complex 4 deficiency: a paradigm of childhood-onset hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia caused by defective protein trafficking.
PG  - 320-334
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddz310 [doi]
AB  - Deficiency of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4) leads to childhood-onset 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP): SPG47 (AP4B1), SPG50 (AP4M1), SPG51 
      (AP4E1) and SPG52 (AP4S1). This study aims to evaluate the impact of 
      loss-of-function variants in AP-4 subunits on intracellular protein trafficking 
      using patient-derived cells. We investigated 15 patient-derived fibroblast lines and 
      generated six lines of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons covering 
      a wide range of AP-4 variants. All patient-derived fibroblasts showed reduced levels 
      of the AP4E1 subunit, a surrogate for levels of the AP-4 complex. The autophagy 
      protein ATG9A accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and was depleted from 
      peripheral compartments. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 3-5-fold increase in 
      ATG9A expression in patient lines. ATG9A was redistributed upon re-expression of 
      AP4B1 arguing that mistrafficking of ATG9A is AP-4-dependent. Examining the 
      downstream effects of ATG9A mislocalization, we found that autophagic flux was 
      intact in patient-derived fibroblasts both under nutrient-rich conditions and when 
      autophagy is stimulated. Mitochondrial metabolism and intracellular iron content 
      remained unchanged. In iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with 
      AP4B1-associated SPG47, AP-4 subunit levels were reduced while ATG9A accumulated in 
      the trans-Golgi network. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II were reduced, 
      suggesting a neuron-specific alteration in autophagosome turnover. Neurite outgrowth 
      and branching were reduced in AP-4-HSP neurons pointing to a role of AP-4-mediated 
      protein trafficking in neuronal development. Collectively, our results establish 
      ATG9A mislocalization as a key marker of AP-4 deficiency in patient-derived cells, 
      including the first human neuron model of AP-4-HSP, which will aid diagnostic and 
      therapeutic studies.

TI  - Oxidative Stress-Induced Axon Fragmentation Is a Consequence of Reduced Axonal

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders characterized 
      by progressive spasticity and paralysis of the lower limbs. Autosomal dominant 
      mutations in SPAST gene account for ∼40% of adult-onset patients. We have previously 
      shown that SPAST patient cells have reduced organelle transport and are therefore 
      more sensitive to oxidative stress. To test whether these effects are present in 
      neuronal cells, we first generated 11 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines from 
      fibroblasts of three healthy controls and three HSP patients with different SPAST 
      mutations. These cells were differentiated into FOXG1-positive forebrain neurons and 
      then evaluated for multiple aspects of axonal transport and fragmentation. Patient 
      neurons exhibited reduced levels of SPAST encoded spastin, as well as a range of 
      axonal deficits, including reduced levels of stabilized microtubules, lower 
      peroxisome transport speed as a consequence of reduced microtubule-dependent 
      transport, reduced number of peroxisomes, and higher density of axon swellings. 
      Patient axons fragmented significantly more than controls following hydrogen 
      peroxide exposure, suggesting for the first time that the SPAST patient axons are 
      more sensitive than controls to the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. 
      Treatment of patient neurons with tubulin-binding drugs epothilone D and noscapine 
      rescued axon peroxisome transport and protected them against axon fragmentation 
      induced by oxidative stress, showing that SPAST patient axons are vulnerable to 
      oxidative stress-induced degeneration as a consequence of reduced axonal transport.

TI  - Truncating variants in UBAP1 associated with childhood-onset nonsyndromic hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia.
PG  - 632-640
LID - 10.1002/humu.23950 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of disorders with predominant 
      symptoms of lower-extremity weakness and spasticity. Despite the delineation of 
      numerous genetic causes of HSP, a significant portion of individuals with HSP remain 
      molecularly undiagnosed. Through exome sequencing, we identified five unrelated 
      families with childhood-onset nonsyndromic HSP, all presenting with progressive 
      spastic gait, leg clonus, and toe walking starting from 7 to 8 years old. A 
      recurrent two-base pair deletion (c.426_427delGA, p.K143Sfs*15) in the UBAP1 gene 
      was found in four families, and a similar variant (c.475_476delTT, p.F159*) was 
      detected in a fifth family. The variant was confirmed to be de novo in two families 
      and inherited from an affected parent in two other families. RNA studies performed 
      in lymphocytes from one patient with the de novo c.426_427delGA variant demonstrated 
      escape of nonsense-mediated decay of the UBAP1 mutant transcript, suggesting the 
      generation of a truncated protein. Both variants identified in this study are 
      predicted to result in truncated proteins losing the capacity of binding to 
      ubiquitinated proteins, hence appearing to exhibit a dominant-negative effect on the 
      normal function of the endosome-specific endosomal sorting complexes required for 
      the transport-I complex.

TI  - Desflurane for management of decompressive laminectomy in a patient with hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia: a case report.
PG  - 30

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a rare, genetic neurodegenerative 
      condition. Thus far, ideal anesthetic management is not established for patients 
      with HSP; therefore, careful selection and dosage of anesthetic agents is required. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman with HSP, who was diagnosed with severe 
      lumbar spinal canal stenosis, underwent decompressive laminectomy to relieve her 
      back pain. Preoperatively, she experienced slight difficulty in walking 
      independently; however, she exhibited no other dysfunction. Anesthesia was 
      maintained with desflurane after tracheal intubation. Rocuronium and sugammadex were 
      used for neuromuscular blockade and reversal, respectively, with neuromuscular 
      monitoring equipment. The patient showed uneventful postoperative recovery without 
      signs of neurological deterioration after extubation. CONCLUSIONS: Our successful 
      experience in this case implies that, for patients with neuromuscular diseases, 
      including HSP, desflurane may be an option for anesthetic management; moreover, 
      careful assessment (e.g., medical condition, bispectral index, and train-of-four) 
      should be performed prior to administration of anesthesia.

TI  - SPTAN1 variants as a potential cause for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia.
PG  - 1145-1151
LID - 10.1038/s10038-019-0669-2 [doi]
AB  - More than 80 known or suspected genes/loci have been reported to be involved in 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Genetic and clinical overlap have been reported 
      between HSP and other neurological condition, yet about 50% of HSP patients remain 
      genetically undiagnosed. To identify novel genes involved in HSP, we performed a 
      genetic analysis of 383 HSP patients from 289 families with HSP. Two patients with 
      biallelic SPTAN1 variants were identified; one carried the c.2572G>T p.(Ala858Ser) 
      and c.4283C>G p.(Ala1428Gly) variants, and the second also carried the c.2572G>T 
      p.(Ala858Ser) variant, and an additional variant, c.6990G>C p.(Met2330Ile). In 
      silico predictive and structural analyses suggested that these variants are likely 
      to be deleterious. SPTAN1 was highly intolerant for functional variants (in the top 
      0.31% of intolerant genes) with much lower observed vs. expected number of 
      loss-of-function variants (8 vs. 142.7, p < 5 × 10(-15)). Using public databases of 
      animal models and previously published data, we have found previously described 
      zebrafish, mouse, and rat animal models of SPTAN1 deficiency, all consistently 
      showing axonal degeneration, fitting the pathological features of HSP in humans. 
      This study expands the phenotype of SPTAN1 mutations, which at the heterozygous 
      state, when occurred de novo, may cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-5 
      (EIEE5). Our results further suggest that SPTAN1 may cause autosomal recessive HSP, 
      and that it should be included in genetic screening panels for genetically 
      undiagnosed HSP patients.

LID - 967
AB  - Background: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a slowly progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder with no disease modifying treatment. Potential 
      therapeutic approaches are emerging and large-scale clinical drug trials for 
      patients with HSP are imminent. A sensitive biomarker to measure the drug efficacy 
      in these trials is required. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are a potential 
      biomarker for HSP as they assess the central motor pathways and can be standardized 
      with set protocols and guidelines. Objectives: We performed a systematic review to 
      investigate the utility of MEPs as a diagnostic and disease severity biomarker for 
      HSP. Search Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Scopus were 
      performed. Selection Criteria: Studies reporting on central motor conduction time 
      measured with MEPs in adult and pediatric patients with HSP were included. We 
      excluded studies in non-HSP patient cohorts, not in English, not original research, 
      and unpublished journal articles. Data Collection and analysis: Search results were 
      de-duplicated and screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
      included papers were reviewed independently by two reviewers and data was collected 
      on patient cohorts, test methods, results, and study quality. Results were analyzed 
      using descriptive methods. Results: Of the 882 search results, 32 studies were 
      included in the review. The most common finding was absent or prolonged lower limb 
      (LL) central motor conduction time (CMCT) in patients with HSP (78% of patients 
      studied). Quality assessment revealed variability in study methodology and reporting 
      of results. Variations included patient cohorts of various genotypes as well as 
      variations in equipment and techniques used. Aside from CMCT, none of the MEP 
      parameter measures correlated with disease severity and many did not show 
      significant difference between HSP patients and controls. Conclusion: Systematic 
      review of MEP studies in HSP patient cohorts demonstrated mixed findings. Lower limb 
      CMCT was the most promising parameter in terms of differentiating HSP patients from 
      controls, with one study demonstrating a weak correlation with clinical disease 
      severity. It is possible that the lack of consistency in study methodologies and 
      small patient cohorts have contributed to the variable findings. A longitudinal 
      study of MEPs in a large cohort of HSP patients with the same genotype will help 
      clarify the utility of MEPs as a biomarker for disease severity and use in clinical 
      trials.

LID - 119
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in ARL6IP1, which encodes a tetraspan membrane protein 
      localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), have been recently described in a large 
      family with a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We sought to expand the HSP phenotype associated with ARL6IP1 variants 
      by examining a Saudi kindred with a clinically more severe presentation, which 
      resulted in spontaneous neonatal death of both affected siblings. Clinical features 
      encompassed not only spastic paraplegia but also developmental delay, microcephaly, 
      cerebral atrophy, periventricular leukoencephalopathy, hypotonia, seizures, 
      spasticity, jejunal stricture, gastrointestinal reflux, neuropathy, dysmorphism and 
      respiratory distress. We performed clinical assessment and radiological studies of 
      this family, in addition to homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing (WES) to 
      identify the disease-associated variant. Homozygosity mapping localized the 
      causative gene to a region on chromosome 16 harboring ARL6IP1. WES of the index case 
      identified the homoallelic nonsense variant, c.112C > T in ARL6IP1 that segregated 
      with the phenotype and was predicted to result in loss of the protein. Allelic 
      expression analysis of the parents demonstrated downward pressure on the mutant 
      allele, suggestive of nonsense-mediated decay. CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that 
      the phenotype associated with ARL6IP1 variants may be broader and more acute than so 
      far reported and identifies fatal HSP as the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum 
      of ARL6IP1 variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental and epidemiological studies demonstrate a role for 
      27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) in breast cancer development, though results are 
      conflicting. Cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase 
      (CYP7B1) regulate 27HC concentrations, while differential expression of the liver X 
      receptor (LXR) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) may impact the association between 
      27HC and breast cancer risk. METHODS: We evaluated correlates of tumor tissue 
      expression of CYP27A1, CYP7B1, LXR-β, and ERβ and the association between 
      circulating prediagnostic 27HC concentrations and breast cancer risk by marker 
      expression in a nested case-control study within the European Prospective 
      Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Heidelberg cohort including 287 
      breast cancer cases with tumor tissue available. Tumor protein expression was 
      evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and serum 27HC concentrations quantified using 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression models were 
      used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A 
      higher proportion of CYP7B1-positive cases were progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, 
      relative to CYP7B1-negative cases, whereas a higher proportion of ERβ-positive cases 
      were Bcl-2 low, relative to ERβ-negative cases. No differences in tumor tissue 
      marker positivity were observed by reproductive and lifestyle factors. We observed 
      limited evidence of heterogeneity in associations between circulating 27HC and 
      breast cancer risk by tumor tissue expression of CYP27A1, CYP7B1, LXR-β, and ERβ, 
      with the exception of statistically significant heterogeneity by LXR-β status in the 
      subgroup of women perimenopausal at blood collection (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This 
      exploratory study suggests limited associations between tumor marker status and 
      epidemiologic or breast cancer characteristics. Furthermore, the association between 
      circulating 27HC and breast cancer risk may not vary by tumor expression of CYP27A1, 
      CYP7B1, LXR-β, or ERβ.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in KIF1A (kinesin family member 1A) gene have been 
      associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) type 30 (SPG30), encopassing 
      autosomal dominant and recessive, pure and complicated forms. CASE PRESENTATION: We 
      report the long-term follow-up of a 19 years-old boy first evaluated at 18 months of 
      age because of toe walking and unstable gait with frequent falls. He developed 
      speech delay, mild intellectual disability, a slowly progressive pyramidal syndrome, 
      microcephaly, bilateral optic subatrophy and a sensory axonal polyneuropathy. Brain 
      MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, stable along serial evaluations (last performed at 
      18 years of age). Targeted NGS sequencing disclosed the de novo c.914C > T missense, 
      likely pathogenic variant on KIF1A gene. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a previously 
      unpublished de novo heterozygous likely pathogenic KIF1A variant associated with 
      slowly progressive complicated SPG30 and stable cerebellar atrophy on long-term 
      follow-up, adding to current knowledge on this HSP subtype.

TI  - UBAP1 mutations cause juvenile-onset hereditary spastic paraplegias (SPG80) and 
      impair UBAP1 targeting to endosomes.
PG  - 1055-1065
LID - 10.1038/s10038-019-0670-9 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to find a new causative gene and elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying a new type of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Patients with HSP were 
      recruited from the Japan Spastic Paraplegia Research Consortium (JASPAC). Exome 
      sequencing of genomic DNA from patients in four families was carried out, followed 
      by Sanger sequencing of the UBAP1 gene. A mouse homolog of one UBAP1 frameshift 
      mutation carried by one of the patients was created as a disease model. Functional 
      properties of the UBAP1 wild type and UBAP1-mutant in mouse hippocampus neurons were 
      examined. We identified three novel heterozygous loss of function mutations 
      (c.425_426delAG, c.312delC, and c.535G>T) in the UBAP1 gene as the genetic cause of 
      a new type of HSP (SPG80). All the patients presented identical clinical features of 
      a pure type of juvenile-onset HSP. Functional studies on mouse hippocampal neurons 
      revealed that the C-terminal deletion UBAP1-mutant of our disease model had lost its 
      ability to bind ubiquitin in vitro. Overexpression of the UBAP1 wild type interacts 
      directly with ubiquitin on enlarged endosomes, while the UBAP1-mutant cannot be 
      recruited to endosome membranes. Our study demonstrated that mutations in the UBAP1 
      gene cause a new type of HSP and elucidated its pathogenesis. The full-length UBAP1 
      protein is involved in endosomal dynamics in neurons, while loss of UBAP1 function 
      may perturb endosomal fusion and sorting of ubiquitinated cargos. These effects 
      could be more prominent in neurons, thereby giving rise to the phenotype of a 
      neurodegenerative disease such as HSP.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) describes a heterogeneous group of genetic 
      neurodegenerative diseases characterised by progressive spasticity of the lower 
      limbs. The pathogenic mechanism, associated clinical features, and imaging 
      abnormalities vary substantially according to the affected gene and differentiating 
      HSP from other genetic diseases associated with spasticity can be challenging. Next 
      generation sequencing-based gene panels are now widely available but have 
      limitations and a molecular diagnosis is not made in most suspected cases. 
      Symptomatic management continues to evolve but with a greater understanding of the 
      pathophysiological basis of individual HSP subtypes there are emerging opportunities 
      to provide targeted molecular therapies and personalised medicine.

TI  - Δ(1) -Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency: An emergent multifaceted urea 
      cycle-related disorder.
LID - 10.1002/jimd.12220 [doi]
AB  - The bifunctional homooligomeric enzyme Δ(1) -pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 
      (P5CS) and its encoding gene ALDH18A1 were associated with disease in 1998. Two 
      siblings who presented paradoxical hyperammonemia (alleviated by protein), mental 
      disability, short stature, cataracts, cutis laxa, and joint laxity, were found to 
      carry biallelic ALDH18A1 mutations. They showed biochemical indications of decreased 
      ornithine/proline synthesis, agreeing with the role of P5CS in the biosynthesis of 
      these amino acids. Of 32 patients reported with this neurocutaneous syndrome, 21 
      familial ones hosted homozygous or compound heterozygous ALDH18A1 mutations, while 
      11 sporadic ones carried de novo heterozygous ALDH18A1 mutations. In 2015 to 2016, 
      an upper motor neuron syndrome (spastic paraparesis/paraplegia SPG9) complicated 
      with some traits of the neurocutaneous syndrome, although without report of cutis 
      laxa, joint laxity, or herniae, was associated with monoallelic or biallelic 
      ALDH18A1 mutations with, respectively, dominant and recessive inheritance. Of 50 
      SPG9 patients reported, 14 and 36 (34/2 familial/sporadic) carried, respectively, 
      biallelic and monoallelic mutations. Thus, two neurocutaneous syndromes (recessive 
      and dominant cutis laxa 3, abbreviated ARCL3A and ADCL3, respectively) and two SPG9 
      syndromes (recessive SPG9B and dominant SPG9A) are caused by essentially different 
      spectra of ALDH18A1 mutations. On the bases of the clinical data (including our own 
      prior patients' reports), the ALDH18A1 mutations spectra, and our knowledge on the 
      P5CS protein, we conclude that the four syndromes share the same pathogenic 
      mechanisms based on decreased P5CS function. Thus, these syndromes represent a 
      continuum of increasing severity (SPG9A < SPG9B < ADCL3 ≤ ARCL3A) of the same 
      disease, P5CS deficiency, in which the dominant mutations cause loss-of-function by 
      dominant-negative mechanisms.

TI  - Extensive In Silico Analysis of ATL1 Gene : Discovered Five Mutations That May Cause 
      Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Type 3A.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 3A (SPG3A) is a neurodegenerative 
      disease inherited type of Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). It is the second most 
      frequent type of HSP which is characterized by progressive bilateral and mostly 
      symmetric spasticity and weakness of the legs. SPG3A gene mutations and the 
      phenotype-genotype correlations have not yet been recognized. The aim of this work 
      was to categorize the most damaging SNPs in ATL1 gene and to predict their impact on 
      the functional and structural levels by several computational analysis tools. 
      METHODS: The raw data of ATL1 gene were retrieved from dbSNP database and then run 
      into numerous computational analysis tools. Additionally; we submitted the common 
      six deleterious outcomes from the previous functional analysis tools to I-mutant 3.0 
      and MUPro, respectively, to investigate their effect on the structural level. The 3D 
      structure of ATL1 was predicted by RaptorX and modeled using UCSF Chimera to compare 
      the differences between the native and the mutant amino acids. RESULTS: Five nsSNPs 
      out of 249 were classified as the most deleterious (rs746927118, rs979765709, 
      rs119476049, rs864622269, and rs1242753115). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the impact 
      of nsSNPs in the ATL1 gene was investigated by various in silico tools that revealed 
      five nsSNPs (V67F, T120I, R217Q, R495W, and G504E) are deleterious SNPs, which have 
      a functional impact on ATL1 protein and, therefore, can be used as genomic 
      biomarkers specifically before 4 years of age; also, it may play a key role in 
      pharmacogenomics by evaluating drug response for this disabling disease.

AB  - Primary lateral sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are primarily associated 
      with motor cortex and corticospinal tract pathology. A standardised, prospective, 
      single-centre neuroimaging protocol was used to characterise thalamic, hippocampal 
      and basal ganglia involvement in 33 patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), 
      100 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 117 healthy controls. 
      "Widespread subcortical grey matter degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis: a 
      multimodal imaging study with genetic profiling" [1] Imaging data were acquired on a 
      3 T MRI system using a 3D Inversion Recovery prepared Spoiled Gradient Recalled echo 
      sequence. Model based segmentation was used to estimate the volumes of the thalamus, 
      hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, pallidum, putamen and accumbens nucleus in each 
      hemisphere. The hippocampus was further parcellated into cytologically-defined 
      subfields. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was estimated for each participant to aid 
      the interpretation of subcortical volume alterations. Group comparisons were 
      corrected for age, gender, TIV, education and symptom duration. Considerable 
      thalamic, hippocampal and accumbens nucleus atrophy was detected in PLS compared to 
      healthy controls and selective dentate, molecular layer, CA1, CA3, and CA4 
      hippocampal pathology was also identified. In ALS, additional volume reductions were 
      noted in the amygdala, left caudate and the hippocampal-amygdala transition area of 
      the hippocampus. Our imaging data provide evidence of extensive and 
      phenotype-specific patterns of subcortical degeneration in PLS.

AB  - The thalamus is a key cerebral hub relaying a multitude of corticoefferent and 
      corticoafferent connections and mediating distinct extrapyramidal, sensory, 
      cognitive and behavioural functions. While the thalamus consists of dozens of 
      anatomically well-defined nuclei with distinctive physiological roles, existing 
      imaging studies in motor neuron diseases typically evaluate the thalamus as a single 
      structure. Based on the unique cortical signatures observed in ALS and PLS, we 
      hypothesised that similarly focal thalamic involvement may be observed if the nuclei 
      are individually evaluated. A prospective imaging study was undertaken with 100 
      patients with ALS, 33 patients with PLS and 117 healthy controls to characterise the 
      integrity of thalamic nuclei. ALS patients were further stratified for the presence 
      of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72. The thalamus was segmented 
      into individual nuclei to examine their volumetric profile. Additionally, thalamic 
      shape deformations were evaluated by vertex analyses and focal density alterations 
      were examined by region-of-interest morphometry. Our data indicate that C9orf72 
      negative ALS patients and PLS patients exhibit ventral lateral and ventral anterior 
      involvement, consistent with the 'motor' thalamus. Degeneration of the sensory 
      nuclei was also detected in C9orf72 negative ALS and PLS. Both ALS groups and the 
      PLS cohort showed focal changes in the mediodorsal-paratenial-reuniens nuclei, which 
      mediate memory and executive functions. PLS patients exhibited distinctive thalamic 
      changes with marked pulvinar and lateral geniculate atrophy compared to both 
      controls and C9orf72 negative ALS. The considerable ventral lateral and ventral 
      anterior pathology detected in both ALS and PLS support the emerging literature of 
      extrapyramidal dysfunction in MND. The involvement of sensory nuclei is consistent 
      with sporadic reports of sensory impairment in MND. The unique thalamic signature of 
      PLS is in line with the distinctive clinical features of the phenotype. Our data 
      confirm phenotype-specific patterns of thalamus involvement in motor neuron diseases 
      with the preferential involvement of nuclei mediating motor and cognitive functions. 
      Given the selective involvement of thalamic nuclei in ALS and PLS, future biomarker 
      and natural history studies in MND should evaluate individual thalamic regions 
      instead overall thalamic changes.

TI  - A Novel CAPN1 Mutation Causes a Pure Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia in an Italian 
      Family.

AB  - CAPN1 encodes calpain-1, a large subunit of μ-calpain, a calcium-activated cysteine 
      protease widely present in the central nervous system. Mutations in CAPN1 have 
      recently been identified in a complicated form of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 
      (HSP) with a combination of cerebellar ataxia and corticomotor tract disorder 
      (SPG76). Therefore, CAPN1 is now considered one of those genes that clinically 
      manifest with a spectrum of disorders ranging from spasticity to cerebellar ataxia 
      and represent a link between Spinocerebellar Ataxia and HSP, two groups of diseases 
      previously considered separate but sharing pathophysiological pathways. We here 
      describe clinical and molecular findings of two Italian adult siblings affected with 
      a pure form of HSP and harboring the novel homozygote c.959delA variant 
      (p.Tyr320Leufs(*)73) in the CAPN1 gene. Although the reason why mutations in CAPN1 
      may cause heterogeneous clinical pictures remains speculative, our findings confirm 
      that the spectrum of the CAPN1-linked phenotypes includes pure HSP with onset during 
      the third decade of life. Further studies are warrantied in order to clarify the 
      mechanism underlying the differences in CAPN1 mutation clinical expression.

AB  - Hereditary Spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are heterogeneous group of degenerative 
      disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs, 
      combined with additional neurological features. This study aimed to identify 
      causative gene variants in two nonrelated consanguineous Pakistani families 
      segregating HSP. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on a total of five 
      individuals from two families including four affected and one phenotypically normal 
      individual. The variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation 
      analysis. In family A, a novel homozygous variant c.604G > A (p.Glu202Lys) was 
      identified in the CYP2U1 gene with clinical symptoms of SPG56 in 3 siblings. 
      Whereas, a previously reported variant c.5769delT (p.Ser1923Argfs*28) in the SPG11 
      gene was identified in family B manifesting clinical features of SPG11 in 3 affected 
      individuals. Our combined findings add to the clinical and genetic variability 
      associated with CYP2U1 and SPG11 variants highlighting the complexity of HSPs. These 
      findings further emphasize the usefulness of WES as a powerful diagnostic tool.

AB  - Anecdotal oculomotor disturbances have been described in spastic paraplegia type 7 
      (SPG7). We investigated oculomotor and vestibular dysfunction in five patients with 
      genetically verified SPG7. All five patients exhibited significantly slower 
      velocities of vertical saccades compared to controls, but significantly faster than 
      in progressive supranuclear palsy, with upward saccades being particularly affected. 
      Horizontal saccades, cerebellar oculomotor markers, and vestibuloocular reflex seem 
      to be variably affected. Thus, albeit subclinical in some cases, slowing of the 
      vertical saccades may belong to the phenotype of SPG7 and may serve as a valuable 
      biomarker for differentiation from spastic ataxias and atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and Intellectual Disability: Clinicogenetic Lessons 
      From a Family Suggesting a Dual Genetics Diagnosis.
PG  - 41
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2020.00041 [doi]
LID - 41
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders 
      with spastic paraparesis as the main clinical feature. Complex forms may co-occur 
      with other motor, sensory, and cognitive impairment. A growing number of loci and 
      genes are being identified, but still more than 50% of the patients remain without 
      molecular diagnosis. We present a Spanish family with autosomal dominant HSP and 
      intellectual disability (ID) in which we found a possible dual genetic diagnosis 
      with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in the parents and three 
      siblings: a heterozygous duplication of 15q11.2-q13.1 found by array CGH and a novel 
      missense heterozygous change in REEP1 [c.73A>G; p.(Lys25Glu)] found by whole exome 
      sequencing (WES). Following the standard genetic diagnosis approach in ID, array CGH 
      analysis was first performed in both brothers affected by spastic paraparesis and ID 
      from school age, and a heterozygous duplication of 15q11.2-q13.1 was found. 
      Subsequently, the duplication was also found in the healthy mother and in the 
      sister, who presented attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms from 
      school age and pes cavus with mild pyramidal signs at 22 years of age. Methylation 
      analysis revealed that the three siblings carried the duplication unmethylated in 
      the maternal allele, whereas their mother harbored it methylated in her paternal 
      allele. Functional studies revealed an overexpression of UBE3A and ATP10A in the 
      three siblings, and the slightest cognitive phenotype of the sister seems to be 
      related to a lower expression of ATP10A. Later, searching for the cause of HSP, WES 
      was performed revealing the missense heterozygous variant in REEP1 in all three 
      siblings and the father, who presented subtle pyramidal signs in the lower limbs as 
      well as the sister. Our findings reinforce the association of maternally derived 
      UBE3A overexpression with neurodevelopmental disorders and support that a spectrum 
      of clinical severity is present within families. They also reveal that a dual 
      genetic diagnosis is possible in patients with presumed complex forms of HSP and 
      cognitive impairment.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.50860 [doi]
AB  - Homozygous mutations in MAG, encoding the myelin-associated glycoprotein, a 
      transmembrane component of the myelin sheath, have been associated with SPG 75 
      recessive spastic paraplegia. Here, we report the first patient with two compound 
      heterozygous novel MAG mutations (p.A151V and p.S373R) and early developmental delay 
      with a progressive complex phenotype characterized by spastic paraplegia, peripheral 
      sensorimotor neuropathy, intellectual disability, and sensorial dysfunctions with 
      severe optic atrophy and hearing involvement. Brain imaging showed progressive 
      global cerebellar atrophy. We propose that complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, 
      with axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy, sensorial impairment and intellectual 
      disability might suggest MAG mutations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limbs 
      (LL) weakness. There is no treatment to cure or halt the disease, except for 
      symptomatic therapy. The use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is one of the 
      primary treatment for focal spasticity. Physiotherapy (PT) can help in maintaining 
      residual functioning. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of 
      the combined BoNT-A and intensive PT in patients with HSP. METHODS: Eighteen adult 
      patients (50% females) with clinical diagnosis of HSP were recruited. Eleven 
      patients had a genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 72. Patients were all 
      autonomously deambulant or needed support. BoNT-A was injected in 36 LL in different 
      spastic muscles under electromyographic guidance and followed by intensive PT 
      sessions. Outcome measures included disease severity, motor functional measures, 
      perceived pain self-report and quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1 
      and 3 months after BoNT-A injection. RESULTS: Most inoculated muscles were 
      hamstrings, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. We observed an improvement in muscle 
      tone, in the gait velocity and distance length. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale was 
      significantly reduced after treatment, in addition to improving pain and quality of 
      life. These results were riconfirmed in 3 months time. CONCLUSION: Our study 
      indicates that combined treatment of BoNT-A and PT can lead to improvement of 
      spasticity and quality of life in patients with HSP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of five pedigrees 
      affected with hereditary spastic paraplegia(HSP). METHODS: Clinical data of the five 
      pedigrees was collected, and high-throughput sequencing was carried out to detect 
      potential variants. Sanger sequencing were used to verify the results. RESULTS: The 
      probands of pedigree 1 and 2 were found to harbor heterozygous SPAST gene variants, 
      namely c.1196C>T and c.1523T>A. The proband of pedigree 3 harbored compound 
      heterozygous variants of FA2H gene (c.61G>C and c.688G>A). Proband from pedigree 4 
      harbored compound heterozygous variants of SPG11 gene (c.6812+4_6812+7delAGTA and 
      c.915delT). The proband of pedigree 5 harbored compound heterozygous variants of 
      SPG7 gene (c.1703_1704delAG and c.1937-1G>C). Based on the American College of 
      Medical Genetics and Genomics(ACMG) guidelines, all variants were predicted to be 
      likely pathogenic. Among these, SPAST gene c.1523T>A, FA2H gene c.61.G>C, SPG11 gene 
      splicing region c.6812+4_6812+7delAGTA, c.915delT, SPG7 gene c.1703_1704delAG and 
      splicing region c.1937-1G>C variants were unreported previously. CONCLUSION: The 
      probands of pedigrees 1 and 2 were diagnosed with autosomal dominant hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia type 4, for which pedigree 2 showed incompletely penetrance. 
      Pedigrees 3, 4, and 5 were diagnosed with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia type 35, 11 and 7, respectively. Above result provided a reference for 
      clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling for the affected pedigrees.

AB  - Bi-allelic variants in the subunits of the adaptor protein complex 4 lead to 
      childhood-onset, complex hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP): SPG47 (AP4B1), 
      SPG50 (AP4M1), SPG51 (AP4E1), and SPG52 (AP4S1). Here, we describe the generation of 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three AP-4-HSP patients with 
      compound-heterozygous, loss-of-function variants in AP4B1 and sex-matched parents. 
      Fibroblasts were reprogrammed using non-integrating Sendai virus. iPSCs were 
      characterized according to standard protocols including karyotyping, embryoid body 
      formation, pluripotency marker expression and STR profiling. These first iPSC lines 
      for SPG47 provide a valuable resource for studying this rare disease and related 
      forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia.

LID - 10.1097/WCO.0000000000000735 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and related disorders are the 
      commonest group of inherited neuromuscular diseases and represent a heterogeneous 
      group of disorders. This review will cover recent advances in genetic diagnosis and 
      the evolving genetic and phenotype landscape of this disease group. We will review 
      recent evidence of the increasingly recognized phenotypic overlap with other 
      neurodegenerative conditions including hereditary spastic paraplegia, hereditary 
      ataxias and mitochondrial diseases and highlight the importance of deep phenotyping 
      to inform genetic diagnosis and prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Through whole exome 
      sequencing and multicentre collaboration new genes are being identified as causal 
      for CMT expanding the genetic heterogeneity of this condition. In addition, an 
      increasing number of variants have been identified in genes known to cause complex 
      inherited diseases in which the peripheral neuropathy is part of the disorder and 
      may be the presenting feature. The recent discovery of a repeat expansion in the 
      RFC1 gene in cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome highlights 
      the prevalence of late-onset recessive conditions which have historically been 
      considered to cause early-onset disease. SUMMARY: CMT is an evolving field with 
      considerable phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity and deep phenotyping remains a 
      cornerstone in contemporary CMT diagnostics.

TI  - Mitochondrial impairment activates the Wallerian pathway through depletion of NMNAT2

AB  - Wallerian degeneration of physically injured axons involves a well-defined molecular 
      pathway linking loss of axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to activation of 
      pro-degenerative protein SARM1. Manipulating the pathway through these proteins led 
      to the identification of non-axotomy insults causing axon degeneration by a 
      Wallerian-like mechanism, including several involving mitochondrial impairment. 
      Mitochondrial dysfunction is heavily implicated in Parkinson's disease, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia and other axonal 
      disorders. However, whether and how mitochondrial impairment activates Wallerian 
      degeneration has remained unclear. Here, we show that disruption of mitochondrial 
      membrane potential leads to axonal NMNAT2 depletion in mouse sympathetic neurons, 
      increasing the substrate-to-product ratio (NMN/NAD) of this NAD-synthesising enzyme, 
      a metabolic fingerprint of Wallerian degeneration. The mechanism appears to involve 
      both impaired NMNAT2 synthesis and reduced axonal transport. Expression of WLD(S) 
      and Sarm1 deletion both protect axons after mitochondrial uncoupling. Blocking the 
      pathway also confers neuroprotection and increases the lifespan of flies with Pink1 
      loss-of-function mutation, which causes severe mitochondrial defects. These data 
      indicate that mitochondrial impairment replicates all the major steps of Wallerian 
      degeneration, placing it upstream of NMNAT2 loss, with the potential to contribute 
      to axon pathology in mitochondrial disorders.

TI  - Identification of a Mutation in SPG11 in an Iranian Patient with Spastic Paraplegia

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) includes a number of inherited disorders which 
      are characterized by stiffness in the lower extremities and progressive gait 
      disturbance. Mutations in terms of spastic gait genes (SPGs) are responsible for 
      occurrence of different types of HPS with autosomal recessive, X-linked recessive, 
      and autosomal dominant modes of inheritance. In the current case report, we 
      identified a mutation in SPG11 gene in a female patient with progressive stiffness 
      of lower extremities and atrophy of corpus callosum and the "lynx ear" sign in brain 
      MRI. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygote frameshift deletion variant 
      in SPG11 gene (NM001160227: exon 28: c.4746delT, p.N1583Tfs*23). This variant is a 
      null variant classified as a pathogenic variant (PVS1) according to ACMG standards 
      and guidelines. The frequency of this variant in 1000G, ExAC, and Iranome databases 
      was 0. This study shows the role of WES in the identification of disease-causing 
      mutations in a disease such as HSP which can be caused by diverse mutations in 
      several genes.

TI  - Complexity of Generating Mouse Models to Study the Upper Motor Neurons: Let Us Shift 
      Focus from Mice to Neurons.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20163848 [doi]
LID - 3848
AB  - Motor neuron circuitry is one of the most elaborate circuitries in our body, which 
      ensures voluntary and skilled movement that requires cognitive input. Therefore, 
      both the cortex and the spinal cord are involved. The cortex has special importance 
      for motor neuron diseases, in which initiation and modulation of voluntary movement 
      is affected. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is defined by the progressive 
      degeneration of both the upper and lower motor neurons, whereas hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) are characterized mainly by the 
      loss of upper motor neurons. In an effort to reveal the cellular and molecular basis 
      of neuronal degeneration, numerous model systems are generated, and mouse models are 
      no exception. However, there are many different levels of complexities that need to 
      be considered when developing mouse models. Here, we focus our attention to the 
      upper motor neurons, which are one of the most challenging neuron populations to 
      study. Since mice and human differ greatly at a species level, but the cells/neurons 
      in mice and human share many common aspects of cell biology, we offer a solution by 
      focusing our attention to the affected neurons to reveal the complexities of 
      diseases at a cellular level and to improve translational efforts.

AB  - Spastin is a microtubule-severing enzyme encoded by SPAST, which is broadly 
      expressed in various cell types originated from multiple organs. Even though SPAST 
      is well known as a regulator of the axon growth and arborization in neurons and a 
      genetic factor of hereditary spastic paraplegia, it also takes part in a wide range 
      of other cellular functions including the regulation of cell division and 
      proliferation. In this study, we investigated a novel biological role of spastin in 
      developing brain using Spast deficient mouse embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) and 
      perinatal mouse brain. We found that the expression of spastin begins at early 
      embryonic stages in mouse brain. Using Spast shRNA treated NSCs and mouse brain, we 
      showed that Spast deficiency leads to decrease of NSC proliferation and neuronal 
      lineage differentiation. Finally, we found that spastin controls NSC proliferation 
      by regulating microtubule dynamics in primary cilia. Collectively, these data 
      demonstrate that spastin controls brain development by the regulation of NSC 
      functions at early developmental stages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid myelin water imaging (MWI) using a combined gradient and spin echo 
      (GRASE) sequence can produce myelin specific metrics for the human brain. Spinal 
      cord MWI could be similarly useful, but technical challenges have hindered routine 
      application. GRASE rapid MWI was recently successfully implemented for imaging of 
      healthy cervical spinal cord and may complement other advanced imaging methods, such 
      as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative T(1) (qT(1)). OBJECTIVE: To 
      demonstrate the feasibility of cervical cord GRASE rapid MWI in multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder 
      (NMO), with comparison to DTI and qT(1) metrics. METHODS: GRASE MWI, DTI and qT(1) 
      data were acquired in 2 PLS, 1 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 1 primary-progressive 
      MS (PPMS) and 2 NMO subjects, as well as 6 age (±3 yrs) and sex matched healthy 
      controls (HC). Internal cord structure guided template registrations, used for 
      region of interest (ROI) analysis. Z score maps were calculated for the difference 
      between disease subject and mean HC metric values. RESULTS: PLS subjects had low 
      myelin water fraction (MWF) in the lateral funiculi compared to HC. RRMS subject MWF 
      was heterogeneous within the cord. The PPMS subject showed no trends in ROI results 
      but had a region of low MWF Z score corresponding to a focal lesion. The NMO subject 
      with a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis lesion had low values for whole 
      cord mean MWF of 12.8% compared to 24.3% (standard deviation 2.2%) for HC. The NMO 
      subject without lesions also had low MWF compared to HC. DTI and qT(1) metrics 
      showed similar trends, corroborating the MWF results and providing complementary 
      information. CONCLUSION: GRASE is sufficiently sensitive to detect decreased myelin 
      within MS spinal cord plaques, NMO lesions, and PLS diffuse spinal cord injury. 
      Decreased MWF in PLS is consistent with demyelination secondary to motor neuron

AB  - Promutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine adducts in DNA are repaired in humans by 
      O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) in an irreversible reaction. Here we 
      describe the synthesis of a phosphoramidite that allows the preparation of 
      oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) containing a novel tricyclic thio analogue of 
      O(6)-methylguanine in which the third ring bridges the 6-thio group and C7 of a 
      7-deazapurine. These ODNs are very poor substrates for MGMT and poorly recognised by 
      the alkyltransferase-like protein, Atl1. Examination of the active sites of both 
      MGMT and Atl1 suggest large steric clashes hindering binding of the analogue. Such 
      analogues, if mutagenic, are likely to be highly toxic.

LID - practneurol-2019-002300 [pii]

AB  - Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder at the upper 
      motor neurone extreme of the spectrum of motor neurone disease. The diagnosis is 
      clinical and based on the characteristic features of slowly progressive spasticity 
      beginning in the lower limbs, or more rarely with spastic dysarthria, typically 
      presenting around 50 years of age. The absence of lower motor neurone involvement is 
      considered to be a defining feature, but confident distinction of PLS from upper 
      motor neurone-predominant forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be difficult in 
      the first few years. Corticobulbar involvement in PLS is frequently accompanied by 
      emotionality. While there may be dysphagia, gastrostomy is rarely required to 
      maintain nutrition. Cognitive dysfunction is recognised, though dementia is rarely a 
      prominent management issue. PLS is not necessarily life shortening. Specialised 
      multidisciplinary care is recommended. Increasing international research cooperation 
      is required if the aspiration of dedicated therapeutic trials for PLS is to be 
      achieved.

PG  - 82

LID - 82
AB  - Spastic paraplegia type 7 (SPG7), which represents one of the most common forms of 
      autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (MIM#607259), often manifests with a 
      complicated phenotype, characterized by progressive spastic ataxia with evidence of 
      cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI. Recent studies have documented the presence of 
      peculiar dentate nucleus hyperintensities on T2-weighted images and frontal 
      executive dysfunction in neuropsychological tests in SPG7 patients. Therefore, we 
      decided to assess whether any particular MRI pattern might be specifically 
      associated with SPG7 mutations and possibly correlated with patients' cognitive 
      profiles. For this purpose, we evaluated six SPG7 patients, studying the 
      cerebello-cortical network by MRI voxel-based morphometry and functional 
      connectivity techniques, compared to 30 healthy control subjects. In parallel, we 
      investigated the cognitive and social functioning of the SPG7 patients. Our results 
      document specific cognitive alterations in language, verbal memory, and executive 
      function in addition to an impairment of social task and emotional functions. The 
      MRI scans showed a diffuse symmetric reduction in the cerebellar gray matter of the 
      right lobule V, right Crus I, and bilateral lobule VI, together with a cerebral gray 
      matter reduction in the lingual gyrus, precuneus, thalamus, and superior frontal 
      gyrus. The evidence of an over-connectivity pattern between both the right and left 
      cerebellar dentate nuclei and specific cerebral regions (the lateral occipital 
      cortex, precuneus, left supramarginal gyrus, and left superior parietal lobule) 
      confirms the presence of cerebello-cortical dysregulation in different networks 
      involved in cognition and social functioning in SPG7 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. While 
      neuroimaging studies of the brain can detect upper motor neuron degeneration, these 
      brain MRI scans also include the upper part of the cervical spinal cord, which 
      offers the possibility to expand the focus also towards lower motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here, we set out to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal 
      disease effects in the upper cervical spinal cord in patients with ALS, progressive 
      muscular atrophy (PMA: primarily lower motor neuron involvement) and primary lateral 
      sclerosis (PLS: primarily upper motor neuron involvement), and their relation to 
      disease severity and grey and white matter brain measurements. METHODS: We enrolled 
      108 ALS patients without C9orf72 repeat expansion (ALS C9-), 26 ALS patients with 
      C9orf72 repeat expansion (ALS C9+), 28 PLS patients, 56 PMA patients and 114 
      controls. During up to five visits, longitudinal T1-weighted brain MRI data were 
      acquired and used to segment the upper cervical spinal cord (UCSC, up to C3) and 
      individual cervical segments (C1 to C4) to calculate cross-sectional areas (CSA). 
      Using linear (mixed-effects) models, the CSA differences were assessed between 
      groups and correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, a relationship between CSA 
      and brain measurements was examined in terms of cortical thickness of the precentral 
      gyrus and white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract. RESULTS: Compared to 
      controls, CSAs at baseline showed significantly thinner UCSC in all groups in the 
      MND spectrum. Over time, ALS C9- patients demonstrated significant thinning of the 
      UCSC and, more specifically, of segment C3 compared to controls. Progressive 
      thinning over time was also observed in C1 of PMA patients, while ALS C9+ and PLS 
      patients did not show any longitudinal changes. Longitudinal spinal cord 
      measurements showed a significant relationship with disease severity and we found a 
      significant correlation between spinal cord and motor cortex thickness or 
      corticospinal tract integrity for PLS and PMA, but not for ALS patients. DISCUSSION: 
      Our findings demonstrate atrophy of the upper cervical spinal cord in the motor 
      neuron disease spectrum, which was progressive over time for all but PLS patients. 
      Cervical spinal cord imaging in ALS seems to capture different disease effects than 
      brain neuroimaging. Atrophy of the cervical spinal cord is therefore a promising 
      additional biomarker for both diagnosis and disease progression and could help in 
      the monitoring of treatment effects in future clinical trials.

TI  - CAPN1 and hereditary spastic paraplegia: a novel variant in an Iranian family and 
      overview of the genotype-phenotype correlation.
PG  - 1-13

AB  - Purpose: SPG76 is one of the rare forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) which 
      causes by mutations in the CAPN1 gene. The mode of inheritance of SPG76 is autosomal 
      recessive (AR) and so far, only 24 families and 25 mutations in this gene have been 
      reported worldwide. These mutations have been associated with a spectrum of 
      disorders from pure HSP to spastic ataxia. HSP genetically is one of the most 
      heterogeneous neurological disorders and to date, 79 types of HSP (SPG1-SPG79) have 
      been identified, however, it has been suggested that many HSP-genes, particularly in 
      AR-HSPs, remained unknown. AR-HSPs clinically overlap with other neurodegenerative 
      disorders, making an accurate diagnosis of the disease difficult. Therefore, in 
      addition to clinical examination, a high throughout genetic method like whole exome 
      sequencing (WES) may be necessary for the diagnosis of this type of 
      neurodegenerative disorders.Methods and Results: Herein, we present the clinical 
      features and results of WES in the first Iranian family with a novel CAPN1 variant, 
      c.C853T:p.R285* and pure HSP.Conclusion: Some of the previous studies have mentioned 
      that the "spasticity-ataxia phenotype might be conducted to the diagnosis of SPG76" 
      but recently the number of pure HSP patients with CAPN1 mutation is increasing. The 
      present study also expands the mutation spectrum of pure CAPN1-related SPG76; 
      emphasizing that CAPN1 screening is required in both pure HSP and spasticity-ataxia 
      phenotypes. As noted in some other literature, we suggest the clinical spectrum of 
      this disorder to be considered as "CAPN1-associated neurodegeneration".

TI  - Ascending Axonal Degeneration of the Corticospinal Tract in Pure Hereditary Spastic 
      Paraplegia: A Cross-Sectional DTI Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9100268 [doi]
LID - 268
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify structural white matter alterations in patients with pure 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) using high angular resolution diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI). METHODS: We examined 37 individuals with high resolution DTI, 20 
      patients with pure forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia and 17 age and gender 
      matched healthy controls. DTI was performed using a 3 T clinical scanner with whole 
      brain tract-based spatial statistical (TBSS) analysis of the obtained fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) data as well as a region-of-interest (ROI)-based analysis of 
      affected tracts including the cervical spinal cord. We further conducted correlation 
      analyses between DTI data and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: TBSS analysis in 
      HSP patients showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy of the corpus 
      callosum and the corticospinal tract compared to healthy controls. ROI-based 
      analysis confirmed significantly lower FA in HSP compared to controls in the 
      internal capsule (0.77 vs. 0.80, p = 0.048), the corpus callosum (0.84 vs. 0.87, p = 
      0.048) and the cervical spinal cord (0.72 vs. 0.79, p = 0.003). FA values of the 
      cervical spinal cord significantly correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSION: DTI 
      metrics of the corticospinal tract from the internal capsule to the cervical spine 
      suggest microstructural damage and axonal degeneration of motor neurons. The CST at 
      the level of the cervical spinal cord is thereby more severely affected than the 
      intracranial part of the CST, suggesting an ascending axonal degeneration of the 
      CST. Since there is a significant correlation with disease duration, FA may serve as 
      a future progression marker for assessment of the disease course in HSP.

TI  - A deep intronic splice variant advises reexamination of presumably dominant SPG7 
      Cases.
PG  - 105-111
LID - 10.1002/acn3.50967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify causative mutations in a patient affected by ataxia and 
      spastic paraplegia. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome 
      sequencing (WGS) were performed using patient's DNA sample. RT-PCR and cDNA Sanger 
      sequencing were performed on RNA extracted from patient's fibroblasts, as well as 
      western blot. RESULTS: A novel missense variant in SPG7 (c.2195T> C; p.Leu732Pro) 
      was first found by whole-exome sequencing (WES), while the second, also unreported, 
      deep intronic variant (c.286 + 853A>G) was identified by whole-genome sequencing 
      (WGS). RT-PCR confirmed the in silico predictions showing that this variant 
      activated a cryptic splice site, inducing the inclusion of a pseudoexon into the 
      mRNA sequence, which encoded a premature stop codon. Western blot showed decreased 
      SPG7 levels in patient's fibroblasts. INTERPRETATION: Identification of a deep 
      intronic variant in SPG7, which could only have been detected by performing WGS, led 
      to a diagnosis in this HSP patient. This case challenges the notion of an autosomal 
      dominant inheritance for SPG7, and illustrates the importance of performing WGS 
      subsequently or alternatively to WES to find additional mutations, especially in 
      patients carrying one variant in a gene causing a predominantly autosomal recessive 
      disease.

LID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001738 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The gait disturbance in spastic paraplegic patients lowers the gait 
      speed, increases fall risk and eventually lower the quality of life. This study aims 
      to investigate the effect of electrical twitch obtaining intramuscular stimulation 
      (ETOIMS) on spastic paraplegic patients' gait speed and pattern. METHODS: A 
      prospective short-term cohort study was designed in the outpatient clinic of the 
      department of rehabilitation in a tertiary hospital. Patients with spastic 
      paraplegia (N=5) were participated, including spinal cord tumour (N=2), cervical 
      myelitis (N=1), hereditary spastic paraplegia (NIPA1 mutation; N=1) and spinal cord 
      injury (N=1). The participants underwent ETOIMS. The target muscles were the 
      bilateral quadratus lumborum, multifidus inserting to the L4 and L5 spinous process, 
      and gluteus medius. Gait speed, gait pattern and subjective symptoms, including pain 
      scores (measured by visual analogue scale), were compared before and immediately 
      after the intervention. RESULTS: All patients subjectively reported reduced 
      stiffness during walking and alleviated muscular pain in the lower back and gluteal 
      area. After one session of ETOIMS, patient 1-4 showed 57%, 29%, 33% and 6 % 
      improvement in gait speed, respectively, and all patients showed increased pelvic 
      dissociation. CONCLUSIONS: The ETOIMS can be effective in improving gait speed and 
      stability by relaxing the muscles or alleviating the pain in the lower back and 
      gluteal area in spastic paraplegic patients.

TI  - Defining the clinical-genetic and neuroradiological features in SPG54: description 
      of eight additional cases and nine novel DDHD2 variants.
PG  - 2657-2664
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09466-y [doi]
AB  - Recessive mutations in DDHD2 cause SPG54, a complex hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (HSP) with less than forty patients reported worldwide. In this retrospective, 
      multicenter study we describe eight additional SPG54 cases harboring homozygous or 
      compound heterozygous DDHD2 variants. Finally, we reviewed literature data on SPG54, 
      with the aim to better define the phenotype and the brain magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) pattern as well as genotype-phenotype correlations. SPG54 is typically 
      characterized by early-onset (i.e., congenital or, more frequently, infantile) delay 
      in motor and cognitive milestones, coupled or followed by appearance of spasticity. 
      Cognitive impairment is absent in adult-onset cases. Spasticity progresses over 
      time. Abnormal eye movement, found in about 50% of cases, is the feature most 
      frequently associated with spasticity and developmental delay. Cerebellar ataxia is 
      a prominent sign in several patients, including one adult of this study, suggesting 
      to include SPG54 in the differential diagnosis of spastic-ataxia syndromes. Brain 
      MRI shows thin corpus callosum and non-specific periventricular white matter lesions 
      in about 90% and 70% of cases, respectively. Brain MR spectroscopy reveals abnormal 
      lipid peak in 90% of investigated patients. Twenty-one pathogenic changes have been 
      reported so far, many of which are nonsense or small deletion/duplication. Most 
      mutations appear to be private, with only two mutations recurring in three (i.e., 
      R287*) or more families (i.e., D660H). The identification of nine novel variants 
      expands the molecular spectrum of DDHD2-related HSP and corroborates the notion of a 
      quite homogeneous clinical and neuroradiological phenotype in spite of different 
      genotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a heterogeneous group of clinically and 
      genetically neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive gait disorder. 
      Hereditary spastic paraplegia can be inherited in various ways, and all modes of 
      inheritance are associated with multiple genes or loci. At present, more than 76 
      disease-causing loci have been identified in hereditary spastic paraplegia patients. 
      Here, we report a novel mutation in SPAST gene associated with hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia in a Chinese family, further enriching the hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      spectrum. METHODS: Whole genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of the 15 
      subjects from a Chinese family using DNA Isolation Kit. The Whole Exome Sequencing 
      of the proband was analyzed and the result was identified in the rest individuals. 
      RaptorX prediction tool and Protein Variation Effect Analyzer were used to predict 
      the effects of the mutation on protein tertiary structure and function. RESULTS: 
      Spastic paraplegia has been inherited across at least four generations in this 
      family, during which only four HSP patients were alive. The results obtained by 
      analyzing the Whole Exome Sequencing of the proband exhibited a novel 
      disease-associated in-frame deletion in the SPAST gene, and this mutation also 
      existed in the rest three HSP patients in this family. This in-frame deletion 
      consists of three nucleotides deletion (c.1710_1712delGAA) within the exon 16, 
      resulting in lysine deficiency at the position 570 of the protein (p.K570del). This 
      novel mutation was also predicted to result in the synthesis of misfolded SPAST 
      protein and have the deleterious effect on the function of SPAST protein. 
      CONCLUSION: In this case, we reported a novel mutation in the known SPAST gene that 
      segregated with HSP disease, which can be inherited in each generation. 
      Simultaneously, this novel discovery significantly enriches the mutation spectrum, 
      which provides an opportunity for further investigation of genetic pathogenesis of 
      HSP.

TI  - Two types of recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia in Roma patients in compound 
      heterozygous state; no ethnically prevalent variant found.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP or SPG) is a group of rare upper motor neuron 
      diseases. As some ethnically-specific, disease-causing homozygous variants were 
      described in the Czech Roma population, we hypotesised that some prevalent 
      HSP-causing variant could exist in this population. Eight Czech Roma patients were 
      found in a large group of Czech patients with suspected HSP and were tested using 
      gene panel massively parallel sequencing (MPS). Two of the eight were diagnosed with 
      SPG11 and SPG77, respectively. The SPG77 patient manifests a pure HSP phenotype, 
      which is unusual for this SPG type. Both patients are compound heterozygotes for two 
      different variants in the SPG11 (c.1603-1G>A and del ex. 16-18) and FARS2 (c.1082C>T 
      and del ex.1-2) genes respectively; the three variants are novel. In order to find a 
      potential ethnically-specific, disease-causing variant for HSP, we tested the 
      heterozygote frequency of these variants among 130 anonymised DNA samples of Czech 
      Roma individuals without clinical signs of HSP (HPS-negative). A novel deletion of 
      ex.16-18 in the SPG11 gene was found in a heterozygous state in one individual in 
      the HSP-negative group. Haplotype analysis showed that this individual and the 
      patient with SPG11 shared the same haplotype. This supports the assumption that the 
      identified SPG11 deletion could be a founder mutation in the Czech Roma population. 
      In some Roma patients the disease may also be caused by two different biallelic 
      pathogenic mutations.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias are heterogeneous disorders with diversified clinical 
      manifestations, and genetic testing is important for the diagnosis and typing of 
      hereditary spastic paraplegias.Gene panel sequencing containing 55 hereditary 
      spastic paraplegias-related genes was performed to screen the pathogenic genes for 
      hereditary spastic paraplegias. Sanger sequencing was adopted to validate if the 
      family member carried the same pathogenic gene as the proband.Fifteen out of 53 
      patients carried mutation(s) in the screened hereditary spastic paraplegias-related 
      genes. Among the 23 identified mutations, only one mutation had been previously 
      reported as a pathogenic mutation. In the pedigree of case 6, the proband, his 
      mother and uncle all carried the same novel deletion mutation (c.1459delA) at SPAST 
      gene. Based on the pedigree, the disease was inherited in an AD pattern. In the 
      pedigree of case 53, the family disease may be in an X-linked recessive inheritance 
      pattern. The proband (case 53) carried two novel mutations in ALT1 gene and L1CAM 
      gene (c.2511C>A), respectively. The L1CAM gene is the causative gene for the SPG1 
      X-linked recessive-hereditary spastic paraplegias.Our data confirm the genetic 
      heterogeneity of hereditary spastic paraplegias, and SPG4/SPAST were the most 
      frequent forms. The pathogenicity of the novel mutations is worth to be further 
      investigated.

TI  - Lipid metabolic pathways converge in motor neuron degenerative diseases.
PG  - 1073-1087
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz382 [doi]
AB  - Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) encompass an extensive and heterogeneous group of upper 
      and/or lower motor neuron degenerative disorders, in which the particular clinical 
      outcomes stem from the specific neuronal component involved in each condition. While 
      mutations in a large number of molecules associated with lipid metabolism are known 
      to be implicated in MNDs, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the key 
      functional pathways involved, and their inter-relationships. This review highlights 
      evidence that defines defects within two specific lipid (cholesterol/oxysterol and 
      phosphatidylethanolamine) biosynthetic cascades as being centrally involved in MND, 
      particularly hereditary spastic paraplegia. We also identify how other 
      MND-associated molecules may impact these cascades, in particular through impaired 
      organellar interfacing, to propose 'subcellular lipidome imbalance' as a likely 
      common pathomolecular theme in MND. Further exploration of this mechanism has the 
      potential to identify new therapeutic targets and management strategies for 
      modulation of disease progression in hereditary spastic paraplegias and other MNDs.

AB  - Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are phase-I metabolic enzymes playing important roles in 
      drug metabolism, dietary chemicals and endogenous molecules. Age is a key factor 
      influencing P450s expression. Thus, age-related changes of CYP 1-4 families and bile 
      acid homeostasis-related CYPs, the corresponding nuclear receptors and a few 
      phase-II genes were examined. Livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats at fetus (-2 d), 
      neonates (1, 7, and 14 d), weanling (21 d), puberty (28 and 35 d), adulthood (60 and 
      180 d), and aging (540 and 800 d) were collected and subjected to qPCR analysis. 
      Liver proteins from 14, 28, 60, 180, 540 and 800 days of age were also extracted for 
      selected protein analysis by western blot. In general, there were three patterns of 
      their expression: Some of the drug-metabolizing enzymes and related nuclear 
      receptors were low in fetal and neonatal stage, increased with liver maturation and 
      decreased quickly at aging (AhR, Cyp1a1, Cyp2b1, Cyp2b2, Cyp3a1, Cyp3a2, Ugt1a2); 
      the majority of P450s (Cyp1a2, Cyp2c6, Cyp2c11, Cyp2d2, Cyp2e1, CAR, PXR, FXR, 
      Cyp7a1, Cyp7b1. Cyp8b1, Cyp27a1, Ugt1a1, Sult1a1, Sult1a2) maintained relatively 
      high levels throughout the adulthood, and decreased at 800 days of age; and some had 
      an early peak between 7 and 14 days (CAR, PXR, PPARα, Cyp4a1, Ugt1a2). The protein 
      expression of CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, CYP4A1, and CYP7A1 corresponded the 
      trend of mRNA changes. In summary, this study characterized three expression 
      patterns of 16 CYPs, five nuclear receptors, and four phase-II genes during 
      development and aging in rat liver, adding to our understanding of age-related CYP 
      expression changes and age-related disorders.

TI  - SPG7 mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a genetic link to hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia.
LID - 10.1007/s00415-020-09861-w [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) are 
      motor neuron diseases sharing clinical, pathological, and genetic similarities. 
      While biallelic SPG7 mutations are known to cause recessively inherited HSP, 
      heterozygous SPG7 mutations have repeatedly been identified in HSP and recently also 
      in ALS cases. However, the frequency and clinical impact of rare SPG7 variants have 
      not been studied in a larger ALS cohort. Here, whole-exome (WES) or targeted SPG7 
      sequencing was done in a cohort of 214 European ALS patients. The consequences of a 
      splice site variant were analyzed on the mRNA level. The resulting protein 
      alterations were visualized in a crystal structure model. All patients were 
      subjected to clinical, electrophysiological, and neuroradiological characterization. 
      In 9 of 214 (4.2%) ALS cases, we identified five different rare heterozygous SPG7 
      variants, all of which were previously reported in patients with HSP or ALS. All 
      detected SPG7 variants affect the AAA+ domain of the encoded mitochondrial 
      metalloprotease paraplegin and impair its stability or function according to 
      predictions from mRNA analysis or crystal structure modeling. ALS patients with SPG7 
      mutations more frequently presented with cerebellar symptoms, flail arm or leg 
      syndrome compared to those without SPG7 mutations, and showed a partial clinical 
      overlap with HSP. Brain MRI findings in SPG7 mutation carriers included cerebellar 
      atrophy and patterns suggestive of frontotemporal dementia. Collectively, our 
      findings suggest that SPG7 acts as a genetic risk factor for ALS. ALS patients 
      carrying SPG7 mutations present with distinct features overlapping with HSP, 
      particularly regarding cerebellar findings.

TI  - Cortical Damage Associated With Cognitive and Motor Impairment in Hereditary Spastic 
      Paraplegia: Evidence of a Novel SPAST Mutation.
PG  - 399

LID - 399
AB  - To determine the cortical mechanism that underlies the cognitive impairment and 
      motor disability in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), nine HSP patients from a 
      Chinese family were examined using clinical evaluation, cognitive screening, and 
      genetic testing. Controls were matched healthy subjects. White-matter fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial 
      diffusivity (RD; tract-based spatial statistics), cortical thickness (FreeSurfer), 
      and subcortical gray matter (FIRST) based on T1-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor 
      imaging were analyzed. A novel mutation in the SPAST gene (NM_014946.3, c.1321+2T>C) 
      was detected. Patients had motor disability and low Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      (MoCA) scores. Patients showed significantly decreased total gray- and white-matter 
      volumes, corpus callosum volume, cortical thickness, and subcortical gray-matter 
      volume as well as significantly lower FA and AD values and significantly higher MD 
      and RD values in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract. Cortical thickness, 
      subcortical gray-matter volume, and MoCA score were negatively correlated with 
      disease duration. Cortical thickness in the right inferior frontal cortex was 
      negatively correlated with Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale score. Cortical thickness 
      and right hippocampus volume were positively correlated with the MoCA score and 
      subscores. In conclusion, brain damage is not restricted to the white matter in 
      SPG4-HSP patients, and widespread gray-matter damage may account for the disease 
      progression, cognitive impairment, and disease severity in SPG4-HSP.

TI  - Long-Term Gastrocolocutaneous Fistula after Endoscopic Gastrostomy: How Concerned 
      Should We Be?
PG  - 441-447
LID - 10.1159/000497248 [doi]
AB  - Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a safe technique for long-term enteral 
      feeding. The most common PEG-associated adverse events are minor. 
      Gastrocolocutaneous fistula (GCCF) results from misplacement of the PEG tube through 
      the colon. The importance of this complication is not currently defined, and there 
      is no clearly established therapeutic algorithm. The authors report a series of 3 
      cases of GCCF diagnosed and treated in a tertiary center. CASE 1: An 88-year-old man 
      underwent PEG due to head and neck cancer. The procedure was uneventful, and the 
      patient remained asymptomatic. After the first PEG tube substitution performed at 6 
      months, stool drainage through the stoma was observed. Computed tomography (CT) 
      showed a GCCF. After tube removal, the fistula spontaneously closed, and the patient 
      remained under nasogastric feeding until death. CASE 2: A 31-year-old man with 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia was submitted to PEG without early complications. The 
      patient remained asymptomatic, and 7 months later, replacement of the PEG tube was 
      planned. Under endoscopic control, the primary tube was removed, but the balloon 
      replacement tube, introduced through the skin, was not observed in the gastric 
      lumen. CT displayed a GCCF that spontaneously closed after a few days. A combined 
      laparoscopic and endoscopic approach was used to resect the fistula tracts and 
      perform a new gastrostomy. CASE 3: A 45-year-old man with cerebral palsy was 
      referred to PEG. Skin transillumination was only observed transiently, and the 
      abdominal puncture was performed obliquely. The patient remained asymptomatic until 
      the 7th month, when the primary PEG tube replacement was performed. The 
      percutaneously placed substitution tube did not reach the stomach. GCCF was evident 
      on CT. The fistula spontaneously closed, and the patient was referred to elective 
      surgery for laparoscopic gastrostomy. GCCF is an uncommon complication of PEG. Its 
      clinical course seems to be benign with patients remaining asymptomatic under 
      ambulatory enteral feeding for long periods until PEG tube replacement. Spontaneous 
      fistula closure is the rule in this setting. Laparoscopic gastrostomy should be 
      considered when a new PEG is advised and cannot be safely performed due to colon 
      interposition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited disorders 
      characterized by progressive spastic paresis of the lower limbs. Treatment is often 
      focused on reducing spasticity and its physical consequences. To better address 
      individual patients' needs, we investigated a broad range of experienced complaints, 
      activity limitations, and loss of motor capacities in pure HSP. In addition, we 
      aimed to identify patient characteristics that are associated with increased fall 
      risk and/or reduced walking capacity. METHODS: We developed and distributed an 
      HSP-specific online questionnaire in the Netherlands. A total of 109 out of 166 
      questionnaires returned by participants with pure HSP were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Participants experienced the greatest burden from muscle stiffness and limited 
      standing and walking activities, while 72% reported leg and/or back pain. 
      Thirty-five and 46% reported to use walking aids (e.g. crutches) indoors and 
      outdoors, respectively; 57% reported a fall incidence of at least twice a year 
      ('fallers'); in 51% a fall had led to an injury at least once; and 73% reported fear 
      of falling. Duration of spasticity and incapacity to rise from the floor were 
      positively associated with being a 'faller', whereas non-neurological comorbidity 
      and wheelchair use were negatively associated. Higher age, experienced gait 
      problems, not being able to stand for 10 min, and incapacity to open a heavy door 
      showed a negative association with being a 'walker without aids' (> 500 m). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the large impact of spastic paraparesis on the 
      lives of people with pure HSP and contribute to a better understanding of possible 
      targets for rehabilitation.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
      frontotemporal dementia to prion diseases, Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia and optic atrophy type 1, and behavior disorders like neuropsychiatric, 
      hyperactivity and autism spectrum disorders are closely associated with 
      neurobiological deficits. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an extensively 
      studied neurotrophin. BDNF is essential for neuronal genesis, differentiation, 
      survival, growth, plasticity, synaptic viability and transmission. BDNF has emerged 
      as a promising target for regulating synaptic activity and plasticity. An overview 
      of effects and mechanisms of the natural products targeting BDNF is described. This 
      review is an attempt to enumerate the effects of various natural products on BDNF as 
      a novel therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - Are genetic variations in glutathione S-transferases involved in anti-tuberculosis 
      drug-induced liver injury? A meta-analysis.
PG  - 844-857
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.13006 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: As a crucial protective role in the detoxifying 
      mechanisms of drugs, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) may affect an individual 
      patient's susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATLI). 
      However, the results of studies investigate the association between GSTM1, GSTT1 and 
      GSTP1 polymorphisms and risk of ATLI are inconclusive. A meta-analysis on this topic 
      was performed. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and the Chinese National 
      Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were systematically searched to identify relevant 
      studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
      calculated. Heterogeneity among articles and publication bias were also tested. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: After excluding one study as an outlier, the null GSTM1 
      genotype was associated with an increased risk of ATLI (OR = 1.270, 95% CI 
      (1.014-1.590, P = .038), especially in East Asians (OR = 1.501, 95% CI 
      (1.303-1.730). With similar exclusion, the null GSTT1 genotype increased the risk of 
      ATLI in the total population (OR = 1.169, 95% CI: 1.028-1.330) and in Indians 
      (OR = 1.732, 95% CI: 1.229-2.416). No statistically significant association was 
      observed between the mutant GSTP1 genotype with risk of ATLI, which may need more 
      rigorous and uniform case-control or cohort studies for more robust inferences. WHAT 
      IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This up-to-date meta-analysis strongly suggests associations 
      of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms with ATLI. The results show the increased risk of 
      ATL1 with the null GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype on ATLI development. No such association 
      is shown with the mutant GSTP1 genotype.

TI  - Atlastin Endoplasmic Reticulum-Shaping Proteins Facilitate Zika Virus Replication.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.01047-19 [doi]
LID - e01047-19
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site for Zika virus (ZIKV) replication and is 
      central to the cytopathic effects observed in infected cells. ZIKV induces the 
      formation of ER-derived large cytoplasmic vacuoles followed by "implosive" cell 
      death. Little is known about the nature of the ER factors that regulate flavivirus 
      replication. Atlastins (ATL1, -2, and -3) are dynamin-related GTPases that control 
      the structure and the dynamics of the ER membrane. We show here that ZIKV 
      replication is significantly decreased in the absence of ATL proteins. The 
      appearance of infected cells is delayed, the levels of intracellular viral proteins 
      and released virus are reduced, and the cytopathic effects are strongly impaired. We 
      further show that ATL3 is recruited to viral replication sites and interacts with 
      the nonstructural viral proteins NS2A and NS2B3. Thus, proteins that shape and 
      maintain the ER tubular network ensure efficient ZIKV replication.IMPORTANCE Zika 
      virus (ZIKV) is an emerging virus associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and fetal 
      microcephaly as well as other neurological complications. There is no vaccine or 
      specific antiviral treatment against ZIKV. We found that endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER)-shaping atlastin proteins (ATL1, -2, and -3), which induce ER membrane fusion, 
      facilitate ZIKV replication. We show that ATL3 is recruited to the viral replication 
      site and colocalize with the viral proteins NS2A and NS2B3. The results provide 
      insights into host factors used by ZIKV to enhance its replication.

TI  - Stop-gain mutations in UBAP1 cause pure autosomal-dominant spastic paraplegia.
PG  - 2238-2252
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz158 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias refer to a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders resulting from degeneration of the corticospinal tract. Clinical 
      characterization of patients with hereditary spastic paraplegias represents 
      progressive spasticity, exaggerated reflexes and muscular weakness. Here, to expand 
      on the increasingly broad pools of previously unknown hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      causative genes and subtypes, we performed whole exome sequencing for six affected 
      and two unaffected individuals from two unrelated Chinese families with an autosomal 
      dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia and lacking mutations in known hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia implicated genes. The exome sequencing revealed two stop-gain 
      mutations, c.247_248insGTGAATTC (p.I83Sfs*11) and c.526G>T (p.E176*), in the 
      ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1) gene, which co-segregated with the spastic 
      paraplegia. We also identified two UBAP1 frameshift mutations, c.324_325delCA 
      (p.H108Qfs*10) and c.425_426delAG (p.K143Sfs*15), in two unrelated families from an 
      additional 38 Chinese pedigrees with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic 
      paraplegias and lacking mutations in known causative genes. The primary disease 
      presentation was a pure lower limb predominant spastic paraplegia. In vivo 
      downregulation of Ubap1 in zebrafish causes abnormal organismal morphology, 
      inhibited motor neuron outgrowth, decreased mobility, and shorter lifespan. UBAP1 is 
      incorporated into endosomal sorting complexes required for transport complex I and 
      binds ubiquitin to function in endosome sorting. Patient-derived truncated form(s) 
      of UBAP1 cause aberrant endosome clustering, pronounced endosome enlargement, and 
      cytoplasmic accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in HeLa cells and wild-type mouse 
      cortical neuron cultures. Biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments in cultured 
      cortical neurons derived from transgenic Ubap1flox mice confirmed that disruption of 
      UBAP1 leads to dysregulation of both early endosome processing and ubiquitinated 
      protein sorting. Strikingly, deletion of Ubap1 promotes neurodegeneration, 
      potentially mediated by apoptosis. Our study provides genetic and biochemical 
      evidence that mutations in UBAP1 can cause pure autosomal dominant spastic 
      paraplegia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Phrenic nerve conduction study is a marker of hypoventilation in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We aimed to evaluate its intra-rater reliability in 
      healthy subjects and in a cohort of Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) patients. 
      METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects and 16 PLS patients were included. All subjects 
      underwent three phrenic nerve conduction evaluations (time interval: 1 week for 
      healthy controls; 1 year for PLS patients). We analyzed intra-rater reliability for 
      five parameters of the diaphragmatic motor response: latency; negative-peak 
      duration, area and amplitude; peak-to-peak amplitude. RESULTS: Healthy subjects 
      showed excellent inter-test reliability for most parameters (coefficients of 
      variation <10%). In PLS patients coefficients of variation resulted <10% for latency 
      and peak-to-peak amplitude, <20% for remaining parameters. Inter-test reliability 
      was excellent for latency and peak-to-peak amplitude [intra-class correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) > 0.9] and good for negative-peak amplitude and area (ICC 
      0.75 ≥ 0.9); duration was not reliable (ICC = 0.383). Negative peak and peak-to-peak 
      amplitude had the least random error (respectively ±0.136 mV and ± 0.177 mV). All 
      parameters showed homoscedasticity (R2 < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intra-rater reliability 
      is high for phrenic nerve study, especially for latency, peak-to-peak and 
      negative-peak amplitude. SIGNIFICANCE: Phrenic nerve conduction study is a reliable 
      method to monitor respiratory function.

AB  - In 2015-2016, we and others reported ALDH18A1 mutations causing dominant (SPG9A) or 
      recessive (SPG9B) spastic paraplegia. In vitro production of the ALDH18A1 product, 
      Δ(1) -pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), appeared necessary for cracking 
      SPG9 disease-causing mechanisms. We now describe a baculovirus-insect cell system 
      that yields mgs of pure human P5CS and that has proven highly valuable with two 
      novel P5CS mutations reported here in new SPG9B patients. We conclude that both 
      mutations are disease-causing, that SPG9B associates with partial P5CS deficiency 
      and that it is clinically more severe than SPG9A, as reflected in onset age, 
      disability, cognitive status, growth, and dysmorphic traits.

TI  - Sterol metabolism modulates susceptibility to HIV-1 Infection.
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000002591 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an Interferon stimulated gene (ISG), which 
      catalyzes the synthesis of 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC). 25HC intervenes in 
      metabolic and infectious processes as controls cholesterol homeostasis and 
      influences viral entry into host cells.We verified whether natural resistance to 
      HIV-1 infection in HIV-1-exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals is at least 
      partially mediated by particularities in sterol biosynthesis. METHODS: Peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) isolated 
      from 15 sexually-exposed HESN and 15 healthy controls (HC) were in vitro 
      HIV-1-infected and analyzed for: 1) percentage of IFNα-producing plasmacytoid 
      Dendritic Cells (pDCs); 2) Cholesterol signaling and inflammatory response RNA 
      expression; 3) resistance to HIV-1 infection. MDMs from 5 HC were in vitro 
      HIV-1-infected in the absence/presence of exogenously added 25HC. RESULTS: 
      IFNα-producing pDCs were augmented in HESN compared to HCs both in unstimulated and 
      in in vitro HIV-1-infected PBMCs (p<0.001). An increased expression of CH25H and of 
      a number of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (ABCA1, ABCG1, CYP7B1, LXRα, 
      OSBP, PPARγ, SCARB1) was observed as well; this, was associated with a reduced 
      susceptibility to in vitro HIV-1-infection of PBMCs and MDMs (p<0.01). Notably, 
      addition of 25HC to MDMs resulted in increased cholesterol efflux and augmented 
      resistance to in vitro HIV-1-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Results herein show that in 
      HESN sterol metabolism might be particularly efficient. This could be related to the 
      activation of the IFNα pathway and results into a reduced susceptibility to in vitro 
      HIV-1 infection. These results suggest a possible basis for therapeutic 
      interventions to modulate HIV-1 infection.

      Dual pathogenesis of germline non-mosaicism and somatic mosaicism.

AB  - Neurocutaneous disorders are caused by germline and/or somatic mutations and involve 
      the integument and central nervous systems. Congenital melanocytic nevus syndrome is 
      characterized by melanotic skin lesions caused by somatic mutations at codon 61 in 
      NRAS. A large cutaneous lesion raises the risk of central nervous system 
      involvement. We report an 8-year-old girl with a congenital giant pigmented nevus 
      that covered almost her entire back. Despite the absence of any radiological 
      evidence of intracranial melanosis, the patient exhibited progressive limb 
      spasticity with preserved intellectual ability. An extensive genetic analysis 
      identified a specific class of heterozygous germline mutation in SPAST, 
      p.(Arg499His), which is responsible for hereditary spastic paraplegia with infantile 
      onset. In addition, a known heterozygous somatic mutation in NRAS, p.(Gln61Lys) was 
      detected in the cutaneous lesion. This observation recapitulates concomitant 
      mosaicism and non-mosaicism within a single individual and suggests that the 
      possibility of a dual genetic diagnosis should be considered when neurological 
      decline is observed in a patient with a neurocutaneous disorder without any 
      detectable intracranial lesions.

TI  - Description of combined ARHSP/JALS phenotype in some patients with SPG11 mutations.
PG  - e1240
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SPG11 mutations can cause autosomal recessive hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (ARHSP) and juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). Because these 
      diseases share some clinical presentations and both can be caused by SPG11 
      mutations, it was considered that definitive diagnosis may not be straight forward. 
      METHODS: The DNAs of referred ARHSP and JALS patients were exome sequenced. Clinical 
      data of patients with SPG11 mutations were gathered by interviews and neurological 
      examinations including electrodiagnosis (EDX) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
      RESULTS: Eight probands with SPG11 mutations were identified. Two mutations are 
      novel. Among seven Iranian probands, six carried the p.Glu1026Argfs*4-causing 
      mutation. All eight patients had features known to be present in both ARHSP and 
      JALS. Additionally and surprisingly, presence of both thin corpus callosum (TCC) on 
      MRI and motor neuronopathy were also observed in seven patients. These presentations 
      are, respectively, key suggestive features of ARHSP and JALS. CONCLUSION: We suggest 
      that rather than ARHSP or JALS, combined ARHSP/JALS is the appropriate description 
      of seven patients studied. Criteria for ARHSP, JALS, and combined ARHSP/JALS 
      designations among patients with SPG11 mutations are suggested. The importance of 
      performing both EDX and MRI is emphasized. Initial screening for p.Glu1026Argfs*4 
      may facilitate SPG11 screenings in Iranian patients.

TI  - The second mutation of SYCE1 gene associated with autosomal recessive nonobstructive 
      azoospermia.

AB  - PURPOSE: It is estimated that 40-50% of infertility among human couples is due to 
      male infertility. Azoospermia is estimated to occur in 1% of all men and to be 
      the cause of 10-20% of male infertility. Genetic defects, including single gene 
      effects, maybe cause of azoospermia in 20-30% of affected males. Here, we aim to 
      identify the genetic cause of azoospermia in a man who is also affected by 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia. METHODS: The proband was subjected to whole-exome 
      sequencing, followed by a comprehensive in silico analysis to identify the 
      azoospermia causative gene. RESULTS: A novel splice site mutation c.375-2A > G in 
      SYCE1 that is thought to be the cause of azoospermia was identified. This variant 
      co-segregated with azoospermia status in the family that has three additional 
      affected males. CONCLUSION: SYCE1 gene encodes synaptonemal complex (SC) central 
      element 1 protein which contributes to the formation of the synaptonemal complex 
      during meiosis. Syce1 null male and female mice have been shown to be infertile. 
      There have only been two reports on the effects of SYCE1 mutations in humans; it was 
      shown as the cause of primary ovarian failure (POI) in one and as the cause of 
      nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) in another. We suggest that the mutation 
      375-2A > G, which affects the acceptor splice site within intron 6 of SYCE1, is the 
      likely cause of azoospermia and subsequent infertility in the family studied. The 
      finding constitutes the third report of SYCE1mutations that affect infertility in 
      humans and further supports its contribution to this condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogenous group of rare 
      neurodegenerative disorders that present with lower limb spasticity. It is known as 
      complicated HSP if spasticity is accompanied by additional features such as 
      cognitive impairment, cerebellar syndrome, thin corpus callosum, or neuropathy. Most 
      HSP families show autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. On the other hand, autosomal 
      recessive (AR) cases are also common because of the high frequency of consanguineous 
      marriages in our country. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic 
      aetiology in a group of HSP patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 21 patients 
      from 17 families. Six of them presented with recessive inheritance. All index 
      patients were screened for ATL1 and SPAST gene mutations to determine the prevalence 
      of the most frequent types of HSP in our cohort. Whole exome sequencing was 
      performed for an AD-HSP family, in combination with homozygosity mapping for five 
      selected AR-HSP families. RESULTS: Two novel causative variants were identified in 
      PLP1 and SPG11 genes, respectively. Distribution of HSP mutations in our AD patients 
      was found to be similar to European populations. CONCLUSION: Our genetic studies 
      confirmed that clinical analysis can be misleading when defining HSP subtypes. 
      Genetic testing is an important tool for diagnosis and genetic counselling. However, 
      in the majority of AR HSP cases, a genetic diagnosis is not possible.

      Possibly underdiagnosed diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism (IEBAM) cause rare but treatable 
      genetic disorders that can present as neonatal cholestasis or neurological diseases. 
      Without timely primary bile acid treatment, patients may develop liver failure early 
      in life. This study aimed to analyze the types and treatment outcomes of IEBAM in 
      Taiwanese infants and document the allele frequency of CYP7B1 hot spot mutations in 
      the population. METHODS: Urine samples from patients with infantile intrahepatic 
      cholestasis and suspected IEBAM were subjected to urinary bile acid analysis by gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Genetic diagnoses were made using direct 
      sequencing or next-generation sequencing. We also tested healthy control subjects 
      for a probable hot spot point mutation of CYP7B1. RESULTS: Among the 75 patients 
      with infantile intrahepatic cholestasis tested during 2000 -2016, three had 
      ∆(4)-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency with AKR1D1 mutations, and three had 
      oxysterol-7α-hydroxylase deficiency with CYP7B1 mutation. Two patients with 
      ∆(4)-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency were successfully treated with cholic 
      acid. The three unrelated infants with oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiencies had the 
      same p.R112X homozygous CYP7B1 mutation. Two had mild renal or neurological 
      involvement. Among 608 healthy control subjects, the allele frequency of the 
      heterozygous mutation for p.R112X was 2/1216 (0.16%). The only surviving patient 
      with oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency recovered from liver failure after 
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment beginning at 3 months of age. CONCLUSION: 
      Distinct types of IEBAM disease were found in the Taiwanese population. Patients 
      with early diagnosis and early treatment had a favorable outcome. IEBAM prevalence 
      rates may be higher than expected due to the presence of heterozygous mutations in 
      the general population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging 
      characteristics and genetic features of SPG5 in Taiwan. METHODS: Mutational analysis 
      of the coding regions of CYP7B1 was performed by utilizing targeted resequencing 
      analysis of the 187 unrelated Taiwanese HSP patients. The diagnosis of SPG5 was 
      ascertained by the presence of biallelic CYP7B1 mutations. The SPG5 patients 
      received clinical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evaluations. Disease 
      severity was assessed by using the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) and the 
      disability score. Two microsatellite markers as well as 18 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) markers flanking CYP7B1 were genotyped to assess the founder 
      effect of the CYP7B1 p.R112* mutation. RESULTS: Nineteen SPG5 patients from 17 
      families were identified. They typically presented an insidious onset progressive 
      spastic paraparesis with proprioception involvement beginning at age 8 to 40 years. 
      Their MRIs often showed white matter abnormalities in bilateral occipito-parietal 
      regions, spinal cord atrophy, and mild cerebellar atrophy. Six different mutations 
      in CYP7B1 were recognized, including three novel ones (p.N131Ifs*4, p.A295V, and 
      p.L439R). CYP7B1 p.R112* was the most common mutation and present in 88.2% of the 17 
      SPG5 pedigrees. The patients with homozygous CYP7B1 p.R112* mutations had a milder 
      clinical severity. Detailed haplotype analyses demonstrated a shared haplotype in 
      the 25 individuals carrying at least one single allele of CYP7B1 p.R112*, suggesting 
      a founder effect. INTERPRETATION: This study delineates the distinct clinical and 
      genetic features of SPG5 in Taiwan and provides useful information for the diagnosis 
      and management of SPG5, especially in patients of Chinese descent.

AB  - A standardised, single-centre, longitudinal imaging protocol was used to evaluate 
      longitudinal brainstem alterations in 100 patients with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) with reference to 33 patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), 
      30 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 100 healthy controls. "Brainstem 
      pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis: A 
      longitudinal neuroimaging study" [1] ALS patients were scanned twice; 4 months 
      apart. T1-weighted imaging data were acquired on a 3 T Philips Achieva MRI system, 
      using a 3D Inversion Recovery prepared Spoiled Gradient Recalled echo (IR-SPGR) 
      sequence. Raw MRI data underwent meticulous quality control before pre-processing. A 
      Bayesian segmentation algorithm was utilised to parcellate the brainstem into the 
      medulla oblongata, pons and mesencephalon before estimating the volume of each 
      segment. Vertex-based shape analyses were carried out to characterise anatomical 
      patterns of atrophy. Brainstem volume loss in ALS was dominated by medulla oblongata 
      atrophy, but significant pontine pathology was also detected. Brainstem volume 
      reductions were more significant in PLS than in ALS after correcting for demographic 
      variables and total intracranial volume. Shape analyses revealed bilateral 
      'flattening' of the medullary pyramids in ALS compared to healthy controls. Our data 
      demonstrate that computational neuroimaging readily detects brainstem pathology 
      in vivo in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID), which presents itself during childhood, belongs to a 
      group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) that are clinically widely 
      heterogeneous and highly heritable, often being caused by single gene defects. 
      Indeed, NDDs can be attributed to mutations at over 1000 loci, and all type of 
      mutations, ranging from single nucleotide variations (SNVs) to large, complex copy 
      number variations (CNVs), have been reported in patients with ID and other related 
      NDDs. In this study, we recruited seven different recessive NDD families with 
      comorbidities to perform a detailed clinical characterization and a complete genomic 
      analysis that consisted of a combination of high throughput SNP-based genotyping and 
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Different disease-associated loci and pathogenic gene 
      mutations were identified in each family, including known (n = 4) and novel (n = 2) 
      mutations in known genes (NAGLU, SLC5A2, POLR3B, VPS13A, SYN1, SPG11), and the 
      identification of a novel disease gene (n = 1; NSL1). Functional analyses were 
      additionally performed in a gene associated with autism-like symptoms and epileptic 
      seizures for further proof of pathogenicity. Lastly, detailed genotype-phenotype 
      correlations were carried out to assist with the diagnosis of prospective families 
      and to determine genomic variation with clinical relevance. We concluded that the 
      combination of linkage analyses and WGS to search for disease genes still remains a 
      fruitful strategy for complex diseases with a variety of mutated genes and 
      heterogeneous phenotypic manifestations, allowing for the identification of novel 
      mutations, genes, and phenotypes, and leading to improvements in both diagnostic 
      strategies and functional characterization of disease mechanisms.

LID - 10.1111/ene.14213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related genes and 
      mutations have been increasingly discovered recently and an improved understanding 
      of genotype-phenotype relationships may help to predict the disease course and 
      refine genetic diagnosis. METHODS: We collected clinical data and blood samples from 
      268 patients and used next-generation sequencing to comprehensively assay genetic 
      variations in a panel of known ALS genes from 2015 to 2019. RESULTS: Among these 
      patients, the mean age of onset was 52.30 ± 10.42 years with a mean diagnosis delay 
      of 15.90 ± 11.88 months. Patients with SOD1, TARDBP and FUS variants were more 
      likely to suffer from familial ALS. Additionally, carriers of FUS variants displayed 
      the earliest onset, followed by those with SOD1 variants. Patients with NEFH 
      variants showed a closer link to pesticide exposure. Patients with SETX variants 
      were prone to bulbar onset with moderate anxiety problems. No genotype-phenotype 
      relations were found in SPG11 and ERBB4 mutants. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncovered 
      some genotype-phenotype relationships and may help to predict the disease course of 
      patients with ALS in southern China.

TI  - MicroRNA-144 Silencing Protects Against Atherosclerosis in Male, but Not Female 
      Mice.
PG  - 412-425
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313633 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in developed countries. 
      MicroRNAs act as fine-tuners of gene expression and have been shown to have 
      important roles in the pathophysiology and progression of atherosclerosis. We, and 
      others, previously demonstrated that microRNA-144 (miR-144) functions to 
      post-transcriptionally regulate ABCA1 (ATP binding cassette transporter A1) and 
      plasma HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels. Here, we explore how 
      miR-144 inhibition may protect against atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: We 
      demonstrate that miR-144 silencing reduced atherosclerosis in male, but not female 
      low-density lipoprotein receptor null (Ldlr(-/-)) mice. MiR-144 antagonism increased 
      circulating HDL cholesterol levels, remodeled the HDL particle, and enhanced reverse 
      cholesterol transport. Notably, the effects on HDL and reverse cholesterol transport 
      were more pronounced in male mice suggesting sex-specific differences may contribute 
      to the effects of silencing miR-144 on atherosclerosis. As a molecular mechanism, we 
      identify the oxysterol metabolizing enzyme CYP7B1 (cytochrome P450 enzyme 7B1) as a 
      miR-144 regulated gene in male, but not female mice. Consistent with 
      miR-144-dependent changes in CYP7B1 activity, we show decreased levels of 
      27-hydroxycholesterol, a known proatherogenic sterol and the endogenous substrate 
      for CYP7B1 in male, but not female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate silencing 
      miR-144 has sex-specific effects and that treatment with antisense oligonucleotides 
      to target miR-144 might result in enhancements in reverse cholesterol transport and 
      oxysterol metabolism in patients with cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the common malignancy of the bile tract system with 
      extremely poor clinical outcomes, owing to its metastatic property and intrinsic 
      resistance to the first-line drugs. Although it is well-established that cholesterol 
      abnormity contributes to gallstone formation, a leading risk factor for GBC, the 
      link of cholesterol homeostasis with GBC has not been investigated. The present 
      study systematically examined the genes implicated in cholesterol homeostasis, and 
      revealed altered gene expressions of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and sterol 
      sulfonation (SULT2B1), reduced bile acid synthesis (CYP7B1 and CYP39A1) and impaired 
      sterol efflux (ABCA1, ABCG5, LCAT, and CETP) in GBC tissues. Suppression of 
      cholesterol biosynthesis by lovastatin inhibited GBC cell proliferation possibly 
      through attenuating the DNA repair process. Further investigation revealed 
      lovastatin sensitized GBC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and suppressed the 
      activation of CHK1, CHK2, and H2AX during DNA damage response. By using chemically 
      distinct statins, HMGCR depletion or supplementing mevalonate, the product of HMGCR, 
      we showed the inhibitory effects on DNA repair process of lovastatin were due to the 
      blockage of the mevalonate pathway. Subcutaneous xenograft mice model suggested 
      lovastatin promoted the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin, and significantly 
      prolonged the survival times of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, HMGCR ablation 
      repressed tumor growth in vivo, which can be rescued partially by restored 
      expression of HMGCR, suggesting the on-target effects of lovastatin. Therefore, our 
      study provides the clinical relevance of cholesterol homeostasis with GBC 
      progression, and highlights a novel intervention of combined use of lovastatin and 
      cisplatin for GBC.

TI  - Clinical and ultrastructural findings in an ataxic variant of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome.
PG  - 285-294

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kufor-Rakeb syndrome (KRS) is a rare autosomal recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorder manifesting as juvenile-onset atypical parkinsonism with 
      pyramidal signs, supranuclear gaze palsy, dementia and characteristic minimyoclonus, 
      with a notable phenotype variability. The responsible gene ATP13A2 was also 
      associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, uncomplicated early - or late-onset 
      parkinsonism and a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. We present clinical and 
      ultrastructural findings in a 28-year-old woman with novel biallelic ATP13A2 
      mutations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ultrastructural study of the skin and muscle 
      sample was carried out. Sequence analysis of all protein coding exons and 
      exon-intron boundaries of genes was performed on patient's genomic DNA. A 
      proprietary oligonucleotide-selective sequencing method was used for capturing 
      genomic targets and sequencing was performed using Illumina sequencing system. 
      RESULTS: The patient presented with juvenile-onset progressive parkinsonian syndrome 
      and cognitive deterioration, accompanied by mild spastic paraplegia, supranuclear 
      gaze palsy, cerebellar syndrome, peripheral neuropathy and fine myoclonus. Plentiful 
      and varied osmiophilic deposits were found in skin and muscle biopsy. Sequence 
      analysis identified two novel heterozygous variants in ATP13A2: a nonsense variant 
      c.2209C>T, p.(Gln737*) and a 2-bp deletion c.2366_2367delTC, p.(Leu789Argfs*15) 
      causing a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. Oral levodopa treatment was 
      initiated resulting in marked improvement of bradykinesia, rigidity, speech and 
      swallowing. CONCLUSIONS: We report two novel ATP13A2 pathogenic mutations, further 
      expanding the phenotype of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome with the unusual features of ataxia 
      and polyneuropathy. We thoroughly describe ultrastructural findings and document a 
      meaningful response to levodopa.

PG  - 213-218
LID - 10.1007/s13353-020-00552-w [doi]
AB  - Biallelic mutations in the AP4B1 gene, encoding adaptor-related protein complex 4 
      beta-1 subunit, have been recognized as an important cause of a group of conditions 
      leading to adaptor-related protein complex 4 (AP4)-associated hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (SPG47). We describe a homozygous, known variant c.1160_1161delCA 
      (p.Thr387fs) that was found in the largest ever group of patients coming from four 
      families. The patients exhibited early hypotonia progressing to spastic paraplegia, 
      microcephaly, epilepsy, and central nervous system (CNS) defects and global 
      developmental delay that are consistent with the nature of SPG47. Our findings 
      expand phenotypic spectrum of SPG47 to include polymorphic seizures, mild/moderate 
      intellectual disability, and intracerebral cysts as well as point to founder 
      mutation in AP4 deficiency disorders in apparently non-consanguineous Polish 
      families without shared ancestry.

TI  - The effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on the relative expression of the lipid 
      metabolism genes in mouse cholesterol gallstone models.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1186/s12944-020-01334-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies indicate that gallstone formation has genetic components. 
      The abnormal expression of lipid-related genes could be the basis for particular 
      forms of cholesterol gallstone disease. The aim of this study was to obtain insight 
      into lipid metabolism disorder during cholesterol gallstone formation and to 
      evaluate the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on the improvement of bile 
      lithogenicity and its potential influence on the transcription of lipid-related 
      genes. METHODS: Gallstone-susceptible mouse models were induced by feeding with a 
      lithogenic diet (LD) for 8 weeks. Bile and liver tissues were obtained from these 
      mouse models after 0, 4 and 8 weeks. Bile lipids were measured enzymatically, and 
      the cholesterol saturation index (CSI) was calculated to evaluate the bile 
      lithogenicity by using Carey's critical tables. Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of farnesoid X receptor 
      (FXR), liver X receptor (LXR), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily G 
      member 5/8 (ABCG5/8), cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7A1), oxysterol 7-α 
      hydroxylase (CYP7B1), sterol 27-α hydroxylase (CYP27A1), peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and adenosine triphosphate-binding 
      cassette subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11). RESULTS: The rate of gallstone formation 
      was 100% in the 4-week group but only 30% in the UDCA-treated group. The 
      UDCA-treated group had a significantly lower CSI compared with other groups. Of 
      special note, the data on the effects of UDCA showed higher expression levels of 
      ABCG8, ABCB11 and CYP27A1, as well as lower expression levels of LXR and PPAR-α, 
      compared to the model control group. CONCLUSIONS: UDCA exhibits tremendously potent 
      activity in restraining lipid accumulation, thus reversing the lithogenic effect and 
      protecting hepatocytes from serious pathological damage. The abnormal expression of 
      ABCG8, CYP7A1, CYP27A1, LXR and PPAR-α might lead to high lithogenicity of bile. 
      These results are helpful in exploring new lipid metabolism pathways and potential 
      targets for the treatment of cholesterol stones and for providing some basis for the 
      study of the pathogenesis and genetic characteristics of cholelithiasis. Research on 
      the mechanism of UDCA in improving lipid metabolism and bile lithogenicity may be 
      helpful for clinical treatment and for reducing the incidence of gallstones.

TI  - Janus-faced spatacsin (SPG11): involvement in neurodevelopment and multisystem 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of rare motor neuron 
      disorders characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. 
      HSP type 11 (SPG11-HSP) is linked to pathogenic variants in the SPG11 gene and it 
      represents the most frequent form of complex autosomal recessive HSP. The majority 
      of SPG11-HSP patients exhibit additional neurological symptoms such as cognitive 
      decline, thin corpus callosum, and peripheral neuropathy. Yet, the mechanisms of 
      SPG11-linked spectrum diseases are largely unknown. Recent findings indicate that 
      spatacsin, the 280 kDa protein encoded by SPG11, may impact the autophagy-lysosomal 
      machinery. In this update, we summarize the current knowledge of SPG11-HSP. In 
      addition to clinical symptoms and differential diagnosis, our work aims to link the 
      different clinical manifestations with the respective structural abnormalities and 
      cellular in vitro phenotypes. Moreover, we describe the impact of localization and 
      function of spatacsin in different neuronal systems. Ultimately, we propose a model 
      in which spatacsin bridges between neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
      phenotypes of SPG11-linked disorders.

      Spastic Paraplegia Patients.
PG  - 1490-1499
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2937574 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) represents a group of orphan neurodegenerative 
      diseases with gait disturbance as the predominant clinical feature. Due to its 
      rarity, research within this field is still limited. Aside from clinical analysis 
      using established scales, gait analysis has been employed to enhance the 
      understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease. However, state of the art gait 
      analysis systems are often large, immobile and expensive. To overcome these 
      limitations, this paper presents the first clinically relevant mobile gait analysis 
      system for HSP patients. We propose an unsupervised model based on local cyclicity 
      estimation and hierarchical hidden Markov models (LCE-hHMM). The system provides 
      stride time, swing time, stance time, swing duration and cadence. These parameters 
      are validated against a GAITRite system and manual sensor data labelling using a 
      total of 24 patients within 2 separate studies. The proposed system achieves a 
      stride time error of -0.00  ± 0.09 s (correlation coefficient, r = 1.00) and a swing 
      duration error of -0.67  ± 3.27 % (correlation coefficient, r = 0.93) with respect 
      to the GAITRite system. We show that these parameters are also correlated to the 
      clinical spastic paraplegia rating scale (SPRS) in a similar manner to other state 
      of the art gait analysis systems, as well as to supervised and general versions of 
      the proposed model. Finally, we show a proof of concept for this system to be used 
      to analyse alterations in the gait of individual patients. Thus, with further 
      clinical studies, due to its automated approach and mobility, this system could be 
      used to determine treatment effects in future clinical trials.

TI  - Characterization of the Interaction of Neuropathy Target Esterase with the 
      Endoplasmic Reticulum and Lipid Droplets.
LID - 10.3390/biom9120848 [doi]
LID - 848
AB  - : Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized 
      phospholipase that deacylates phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine 
      (LPC). Loss-of-function mutations in the human NTE gene have been associated with a 
      spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, 
      ataxia and chorioretinal dystrophy. Despite this, little is known about 
      structure-function relationships between NTE protein domains, enzymatic activity and 
      the interaction with cellular organelles. In the current study we show that the 
      C-terminal region of NTE forms a catalytically active domain that exhibits high 
      affinity for lipid droplets (LDs), cellular storage organelles for triacylglycerol 
      (TAG), which have been recently implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Ectopic expression of the C domain in cultured cells decreases cellular 
      PC, elevates TAG and induces LD clustering. LD interactions of NTE are inhibited by 
      default by a non-enzymatic regulatory (R) region with three putative nucleotide 
      monophosphate binding sites. Together with a N-terminal TMD the R region promotes 
      proper distribution of the catalytic C-terminal region to the ER network. Taken 
      together, our data indicate that NTE may exhibit dynamic interactions with the ER 
      and LDs depending on the interplay of its functional regions. Mutations that disrupt 
      this interplay may contribute to NTE-associated disorders by affecting NTE 
      positioning.

TI  - Macroglossia in primary lateral sclerosis: a case report.
PG  - 1189-1191
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2019.1645141 [doi]
AB  - Purpose/Aim: Macroglossia is a rare condition, especially in patients with motor 
      neuron disease. In this case report, we describe a patient with macroglossia in the 
      early stages of motor neuron disease. Case report: A 62-year-old woman presented 
      with macroglossia in the early stages of motor neuron disease. She was referred to 
      the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation of a university hospital for 
      rehabilitation with the diagnosis of motor neuron disease, most likely primary 
      lateral sclerosis. Her speech was incomprehensible, and she also showed significant 
      sialorrhea and had difficulty in chewing large solid food. Her tongue was enlarged 
      on examination, and she could not close her mouth fully. No other possible causes of 
      macroglossia were found. She showed nocturnal hypercapnia on overnight capnography 
      examination coupled with desaturation, which was believed to result from the 
      macroglossia. After commencing non-invasive ventilation with pressure control mode, 
      follow-up overnight capnography revealed EtCO(2) values within the normal range. 
      Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of macroglossia 
      in PLS. Further study would be needed to ascertain the pathogenesis of this 
      phenomenon.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetically and clinically 
      heterogeneous neurologic disorders. Hereby we describe a relatively large group of 
      patients (pts) affected by HSP studied at baseline (31 pts) and at follow-up (mean 
      period 28.9 ± 8.4 months; 23 pts) with multimodal advanced MRI: high-resolution T1 
      images for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
      (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). An age-matched healthy control (HC) group 
      underwent the same neuroimaging protocol in a time schedule matched with the HSP 
      patients. At baseline, VBM showed gray matter (GM) reduction in HSP in the right 
      pre-frontal cortex and bilaterally in the thalami. MRS at baseline depicted in HSP 
      patients compared to the HC group reduction of NAA/Cr ratio in the right pre-frontal 
      region, increase of Cho/Cr ratio in the right pre-central regions, and increase of 
      mI/Cr ratio on the left pre-central area. At cross-sectional follow-up analysis and 
      longitudinal evaluation, no VBM and MRS statistically significant results were 
      obtained. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis showed widespread DTI brain 
      white matter (WM) alterations in patients compared to HC at baseline, which are 
      characterized by reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and increase of mean 
      diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity, as confirmed on 
      cross-analysis of the follow-up dataset. A longitudinal analysis with TBSS in HSP 
      patients did not show significant variations, while upon applying region-based 
      analysis we found increased FA and decreased MD and AD in specific brain WM fiber 
      complex during follow-up. The changes were not correlated with the clinical 
      presentation (pure vs complicated HSP), motor function, and motility indexes or 
      history of specific treatments (botulinum toxin). In conclusion, the cross-sectional 
      analysis of the multiparametric MRI data in our HSP patients confirmed the 
      non-prominent involvement of the cortex in the primary motor regions but rather of 
      other more associative areas. On the contrary, DTI demonstrated a widespread 
      involvement of the brain WM, including the primary motor regions, which was 
      confirmed at follow-up. The longitudinal analysis revealed an apparent inversion of 
      tendency when considering the expected evolution of a neurodegenerative process: we 
      detected an increase of FA and a decrease of MD and AD. These time-related 
      modifications may suggest a repair attempt by the residual central WM fibers, which 
      requires confirmation with a larger group of patients and with a longer time 
      interval.

AB  - Axonal degeneration is a key pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a disorder characterized by spasticity in the 
      lower limbs. Treatments for HSP and other neurodegenerative diseases are mainly 
      symptomatic. While iPSC-derived neurons are valuable for drug discovery and target 
      identification, these applications require robust differentiation paradigms and 
      rapid phenotypic read-outs ranging between hours and a few days. Using spastic 
      paraplegia type 4 (SPG4, the most frequent HSP subtype) as an exemplar, we here 
      present three rapid phenotypic assays for uncovering neuronal process pathologies in 
      iPSC-derived glutamatergic cortical neurons. Specifically, these assays detected a 
      51% reduction in neurite outgrowth and a 60% increase in growth cone area already 
      24 hours after plating; axonal swellings, a hallmark of HSP pathology, was 
      discernible after only 5 days. Remarkably, the identified phenotypes were neuron 
      subtype-specific and not detectable in SPG4-derived GABAergic forebrain neurons. We 
      transferred all three phenotypic assays to a 96-well setup, applied small molecules 
      and found that a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist rescued all three phenotypes in HSP 
      neurons, providing a potential drug target for HSP treatment. We expect this 
      multiparametric and rapid phenotyping approach to accelerate development of 
      therapeutic compounds for HSP and other neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Lipoxin-Induced Phenotypic Changes in CD115(+)LY6C(hi) Monocytes TAM Precursors 
      Inhibits Tumor Development.

AB  - During tumor development, the spleen acts as an extra-medullar reservoir of LY6C(hi) 
      inflammatory monocytes, which can migrate toward tumor to differentiate into 
      tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs), renewing the TAM population. In the tumor 
      microenvironment, pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) acquire anti-inflammatory and 
      pro-tumor (M2) characteristics favoring tumor development. We previously 
      demonstrated that lipoxins, a family of pro-resolving lipid mediators, restored in 
      vitro the cytotoxic M1-like properties of TAMs. Objective: In this study, we have 
      investigated in vivo the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor property of 
      lipoxins. Methods: Fourteen days after inducing B16-F10 melanoma tumors, mice 
      received one single dose of ATL-1 (1 μg/i.v.), a lipoxin A4 analog. After further 7 
      days, blood and bone-marrow were collected, tumors and spleens were removed, and 
      TAMs and blood monocytes were isolated. Results: While the population of LY6C(hi) 
      monocytes was increased in non-treated tumor-bearing mice, the treatment with ATL-1 
      diminished the population of LY6C(hi) monocytes in spleen, blood and bone marrow, 
      decreasing macrophage infiltration into the tumor and reducing the M2 markers 
      expression on TAMs. Importantly, those effects were accompanied by an impairment of 
      tumor growth and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. The data evidence the 
      anti-tumor mechanism of ATL-1, by decreasing the availability of TAM-precursor 
      monocytes and changing TAMs profile in vivo, impairing tumor progression. ATL-1 may 
      become a new tool in cancer control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The regional distribution of cerebral morphological alterations in 
      primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is considered to include the area III of the corpus 
      callosum (CC). OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to investigate regional white 
      matter (WM) alterations in the callosal area III by T1 weighted magnetic resonance 
      imaging (T1w-MRI) data in PLS patients compared with healthy controls, in order to 
      identify atrophy and texture changes in vivo. METHODS: T1w-MRI-based white matter 
      mapping was used to perform an operator-independent CC-segmentation for the 
      different areas of the CC in 67 PLS patients vs 82 matched healthy controls and vs 
      85 ALS patients. The segmentation was followed by texture analysis of the separated 
      CC areas for the PLS patients vs controls and vs ALS patients. RESULTS: PLS was 
      associated with significant atrophy in the area III of the CC (but not in the other 
      callosal segments), while the alterations in the ALS patients were much more 
      variable and were not significant at the group level. Furthermore, significant 
      regional alterations of the texture parameters entropy and homogeneity in this area 
      were shown in PLS patients and in ALS patients. CONCLUSIONS: This T1w-MRI study 
      demonstrated focused regional CC atrophy and texture alterations limited to the 
      callosal area III (which comprises fibers projecting into the primary motor 
      cortices) in PLS, in comparison to a higher variability in CC size in ALS.

TI  - Roles of protrudin at interorganelle membrane contact sites.
PG  - 312-320
LID - 10.2183/pjab.95.023 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular organelles were long viewed as isolated compartments floating in the 
      cytosol. However, this view has been radically changed within the last decade by the 
      discovery that most organelles communicate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      network via membrane contact sites (MCSs) that are essential for intracellular 
      homeostasis. Protrudin is an ER resident protein that was originally shown to 
      regulate neurite formation by promoting endosome trafficking. More recently, 
      however, protrudin has been found to serve as a tethering factor at MCSs. The roles 
      performed by protrudin at MCSs are mediated by its various domains, including 
      inactivation of the small GTPase Rab11, bending of the ER membrane, and functional 
      interactions with other molecules such as the motor protein KIF5 and the ER protein 
      VAP. Mutations in the protrudin gene (ZFYVE27) are associated with hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia, an axonopathy that results from defective ER structure. This 
      review, examines the pleiotropic molecular functions of protrudin and its role in 
      interorganellar communication.

TI  - Non-motor symptoms are relevant and possibly treatable in hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia type 4 (SPG4).
PG  - 369-379
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09573-w [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) share as cardinal feature progressive spastic 
      gait disorder. SPG4 accounts for about 25% of cases and is caused by mutations in 
      the SPAST gene. Although HSP is an upper motor neuron disease, the relevance of 
      non-motor symptoms is increasingly recognized because of the potential response to 
      treatment. Our study sets out to evaluate non-motor symptoms and their relevance 
      with regard to health-related quality of life. In 118 genetically confirmed SPG4 
      cases and age- and gender-matched controls, validated questionnaires were used to 
      evaluate fatigue, depression, pain, and restless legs syndrome. In addition, 
      self-reported medical information was collected concerning comorbidities and 
      bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. In a sub-study, cognition was evaluated 
      using the CANTAB(®) test-battery and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 26 SPG4 
      patients. We found depression and pain to be significantly increased. The frequency 
      of restless legs syndrome varied largely depending on defining criteria. There were 
      no significant deficits in cognition as examined by CANTAB(®) despite a significant 
      increase in self-reported memory impairment in SPG4 patients. Bladder, sexual, and 
      defecation problems were frequent and seemed to be underrecognized in current 
      treatment strategies. All identified non-motor symptoms correlated with 
      health-related quality of life, which was reduced in SPG4 compared to controls. We 
      recommend that clinicians regularly screen for depression, pain, and fatigue and ask 
      for bladder, sexual, and defecation problems to recognize and treat non-motor 
      symptoms accordingly to improve quality of life in patients with SPG4.

TI  - Mutations in the m-AAA proteases AFG3L2 and SPG7 are causing isolated dominant optic 
      atrophy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the genetic diagnosis of dominant optic atrophy (DOA), the 
      most frequently inherited optic nerve disease, and infer genotype-phenotype 
      correlations. METHODS: Exonic sequences of 22 genes were screened by new-generation 
      sequencing in patients with DOA who were investigated for ophthalmology, neurology, 
      and brain MRI. RESULTS: We identified 7 and 8 new heterozygous pathogenic variants 
      in SPG7 and AFG3L2. Both genes encode for mitochondrial matricial AAA (m-AAA) 
      proteases, initially involved in recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 7 
      (HSP7) and dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28), respectively. Notably, 
      variants in AFG3L2 that result in DOA are located in different domains to those 
      reported in SCA28, which likely explains the lack of clinical overlap between these 
      2 phenotypic manifestations. In comparison, the SPG7 variants identified in DOA are 
      interspersed among those responsible for HSP7 in which optic neuropathy has 
      previously been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our results position SPG7 and AFG3L2 as 
      candidate genes to be screened in DOA and indicate that regulation of mitochondrial 
      protein homeostasis and maturation by m-AAA proteases are crucial for the 
      maintenance of optic nerve physiology.

AB  - Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) presents with clinical signs of slowly 
      progressive long tract dysfunction that can overlap with neurodegenerative 
      disorders, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Herein, we present two 
      siblings in whom we have identified a novel mutation in the paraplegin (SPG7) gene. 
      The proband, a 49-year-old woman, presented with a five-year history of progressive 
      spastic paraparesis and ataxia. Brain MRI showed mild cerebellar atrophy. The 
      genetic study revealed a homozygous mutation in the SPG7 gene, that led to the 
      diagnosis of HSP. Four years previously, the younger brother had complained of 
      slowly progressive spastic-ataxic gait, that started one year before; MRI had 
      disclosed multiple areas of white matter hyperintensity with contrast enhancement. A 
      diagnosis of active PPMS was made, and the patient started Disease-Modifying Therapy 
      with further clinical and radiological stability. Once a genetic diagnosis was 
      achieved in his sister, the patient underwent SPG7 testing, which disclosed the same 
      mutation. Whether MS is a mimicry of HSP or it represents "double trouble" condition 
      in this patient, it remains undetermined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the role of hyperexcitable short-latency stretch reflexes 
      (SLRs) on balance control in people with hereditary spastic paraplegia (PwHSP). 
      METHODS: Sixteen PwHSP with triceps surae spasticity and 9 healthy control subjects 
      were subjected to toes-up support-surface perturbations. EMG data were recorded from 
      gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior. Furthermore, center-of-mass 
      trajectories were recorded. RESULTS: PwHSP were less able to withstand the 
      perturbations. Triceps surae SLRs (40-80 ms post perturbation) in PwHSP were 
      increased compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, a sustained triceps surae EMG 
      activity at 220-320 ms post perturbation was observed in PwHSP, whereas control 
      subjects demonstrated suppression of triceps surae activity. Center of mass 
      trajectories started to diverge between PwHSP and controls only after ∼500 ms, with 
      greater excursions being observed in the PwHSP. CONCLUSIONS: The present results 
      confirm that balance control is impaired in PwHSP. However, the late instant of 
      center of mass divergence argues against a direct, causative role of hyperexcitable 
      SLRs in the triceps surae. SIGNIFICANCE: We postulate that enhanced short-latency 
      stretch reflexes of the triceps surae do not underlie poor balance control in PwHSP. 
      Instead, we suggest the lack of suppression of later triceps surae activity to be 
      the main cause.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant GCH1 mutations are known to cause dopa-responsive 
      dystonia (DRD). In this case series, we confirm a variant phenotype, characterized 
      by predominant spastic paraplegia at disease onset with development of dystonia 
      and/or parkinsonism only decades later. METHODS: Clinical trajectories of four 
      patients from three families with pathogenic variants in GCH1 are described, 
      illustrated by videos of the motor phenotype before and during treatment with 
      levodopa. An extensive literature review was performed on previous reports of 
      spasticity in patients with autosomal dominant GCH1 mutations. RESULTS: All patients 
      presented during childhood or early adolescence with gait and leg spasticity. Three 
      patients developed basal ganglia signs only in the fifth decade; the youngest 
      patient has not yet developed dystonia, bradykinesia or hypokinesia. All patients 
      responded to levodopa/carbidopa with improvement of gait and of dystonia, 
      hypokinesia and/or rigidity. In all patients, spasticity decreased but did not 
      disappear. Spasticity has been described previously in DRD, but in most cases 
      co-existent basal ganglia signs were identified early in the disease course. 
      CONCLUSION: GCH1 mutations may cause a phenotype initially resembling hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP) rather than DRD, with basal ganglia signs developing only 
      after decades. In order not to miss this treatable condition, GCH1 should be 
      included in HSP gene panels and its testing is pivotal in patients with spastic 
      paraplegia, especially if there are concomitant basal ganglia signs and/or diurnal 
      fluctuation.

AB  - The physical continuity of axons over long cellular distances poses challenges for 
      their maintenance. One organelle that faces this challenge is endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER); unlike other intracellular organelles, this forms a physically continuous 
      network throughout the cell, with a single membrane and a single lumen. In axons, ER 
      is mainly smooth, forming a tubular network with occasional sheets or cisternae and 
      low amounts of rough ER. It has many potential roles: lipid biosynthesis, glucose 
      homeostasis, a Ca(2+) store, protein export, and contacting and regulating other 
      organelles. This tubular network structure is determined by ER-shaping proteins, 
      mutations in some of which are causative for neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While axonal ER shares many features with the 
      tubular ER network in other contexts, these features must be adapted to the long and 
      narrow dimensions of axons. ER appears to be physically continuous throughout axons, 
      over distances that are enormous on a subcellular scale. It is therefore a potential 
      channel for long-distance or regional communication within neurons, independent of 
      action potentials or physical transport of cargos, but involving its physiological 
      roles such as Ca(2+) or organelle homeostasis. Despite its apparent stability, 
      axonal ER is highly dynamic, showing features like anterograde and retrograde 
      transport, potentially reflecting continuous fusion and breakage of the network. 
      Here we discuss the transport processes that must contribute to this dynamic 
      behavior of ER. We also discuss the model that these processes underpin a 
      homeostatic process that ensures both enough ER to maintain continuity of the 
      network and repair breaks in it, but not too much ER that might disrupt local 
      cellular physiology. Finally, we discuss how failure of ER organization in axons 
      could lead to axon degenerative diseases, and how a requirement for ER continuity 
      could make distal axons most susceptible to degeneration in conditions that disrupt 
      ER continuity.

TI  - Analyzing Mitochondrial Transport and Morphology in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem 
      Cell-Derived Neurons in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia.
LID - 10.3791/60548 [doi]
AB  - Neurons have intense demands for high energy in order to support their functions. 
      Impaired mitochondrial transport along axons has been observed in human neurons, 
      which may contribute to neurodegeneration in various disease states. Although it is 
      challenging to examine mitochondrial dynamics in live human nerves, such paradigms 
      are critical for studying the role of mitochondria in neurodegeneration. Described 
      here is a protocol for analyzing mitochondrial transport and mitochondrial 
      morphology in forebrain neuron axons derived from human induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSCs). The iPSCs are differentiated into telencephalic glutamatergic neurons 
      using well-established methods. Mitochondria of the neurons are stained with 
      MitoTracker CMXRos, and mitochondrial movement within the axons are captured using a 
      live-cell imaging microscope equipped with an incubator for cell culture. Time-lapse 
      images are analyzed using software with "MultiKymograph", "Bioformat importer", and 
      "Macros" plugins. Kymographs of mitochondrial transport are generated, and average 
      mitochondrial velocity in the anterograde and retrograde directions is read from the 
      kymograph. Regarding mitochondrial morphology analysis, mitochondrial length, area, 
      and aspect ratio are obtained using the ImageJ. In summary, this protocol allows 
      characterization of mitochondrial trafficking along axons and analysis of their 
      morphology to facilitate studies of neurodegenerative diseases.

LID - 380
AB  - Mutations in SPG11, leading to loss of spatacsin function, impair the formation of 
      membrane tubules in lysosomes and cause lysosomal lipid accumulation. However, the 
      full nature of lipids accumulating in lysosomes and the physiological consequences 
      of such accumulation are unknown. Here we show that loss of spatacsin inhibits the 
      formation of tubules on lysosomes and prevents the clearance of cholesterol from 
      this subcellular compartment. Accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes decreases 
      cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane, enhancing the entry of extracellular 
      calcium by store-operated calcium entry and increasing resting cytosolic calcium 
      levels. Higher cytosolic calcium levels promote the nuclear translocation of the 
      master regulator of lysosomes TFEB, preventing the formation of tubules and the 
      clearance of cholesterol from lysosomes. Our work reveals a homeostatic balance 
      between cholesterol trafficking and cytosolic calcium levels and shows that loss of 
      spatacsin impairs this homeostatic equilibrium.

      organelles are involved in many cellular roles. While their intracellular dispersion 
      is crucial to ensure their function and other organelles-contact, underlying 
      mechanisms are still unclear. Here we show that Spastin, one of the major proteins 
      involved in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), controls LD dispersion. Spastin 
      depletion in zebrafish affects metabolic properties and organelle dynamics. These 
      functions are ensured by a conserved complex set of splice variants. M1 isoforms 
      determine LD dispersion in the cell by orchestrating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      shape along microtubules (MTs). To further impact LD fate, Spastin modulates 
      transcripts levels and subcellular location of other HSP key players, notably Seipin 
      and REEP1. In pathological conditions, mutations in human Spastin M1 disrupt this 
      mechanism and impacts LD network. Spastin depletion influences not only other key 
      proteins but also modulates specific neutral lipids and phospholipids, revealing an 
      impact on membrane and organelle components. Altogether our results show that 
      Spastin and its partners converge in a common machinery that coordinates LD 
      dispersion and ER shape along MTs. Any alteration of this system results in HSP 
      clinical features and impacts lipids profile, thus opening new avenues for novel 
      biomarkers of HSP.

AB  - FA2H encodes fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, which plays a significant role in maintaining 
      the neuronal myelin sheath. Previous reports have revealed that a FA2H mutation 
      leads to spastic paraplegia, leukodystrophy, and neurodegeneration with brain iron 
      accumulation, collectively referred to as fatty acid hydroxylase-associated 
      neurodegeneration (FAHN). The disease severity of FAHN varies among individual 
      patients and may be explained by the enzyme activity of FA2H mutant proteins. Here 
      we report a 10-year-old Japanese boy with FAHN having novel heterozygous mutations 
      in FA2H. The patient presented with a spastic gait since the age of 5 years and was 
      unable to walk without a cane by the time he was 8 years old. Brain MRI demonstrated 
      a partial thinning of the corpus callosum, slight reduction of cerebellar volume, 
      and posterior dominant periventricular leukodystrophy. Whole exome sequencing 
      revealed two novel missense mutations in FA2H with compound heterozygous inheritance 
      (NM_024306, p.Val149Leu, and p.His260Gln mutations). The enzyme activities of the 
      p.Val149Leu and p.His260Gln variants were 60%-80% and almost 0%, respectively. Our 
      cell-based enzyme assay demonstrated partial functionality for one of the variants, 
      indicating a milder phenotype. However, considered along with previous reports, 
      there was no definite relationship between the disease severity and residual enzyme 
      activity measured using a similar method. Further research is needed to precisely 
      predict the phenotypic severity of this disorder.

TI  - SPG8 mutations in Italian families: clinical data and literature review.
PG  - 699-703
LID - 10.1007/s10072-019-04180-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spastic paraplegia type 8 (SPG8) is an autosomal-dominant form of 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) caused by a mutation in the KIAA0196 gene. 
      SPG8 accounts for 1% of less of all AD-HSP and the genotype-phenotype correlation 
      remains poorly understood. METHODS: We report the first clinical and genetic 
      description of SPG8 disease in Italian patients. We identified four new mutations in 
      KIAA0196 gene. These variants were identified using a multigene targeted 
      resequencing HSP panel. We took this opportunity to review the pertinent literature. 
      RESULTS: Age at disease onset was in the third or fourth decade of life. Stiffness 
      of the lower limb with spastic gait, walking impairment, and decreased vibration 
      sense were common early symptoms. Subjects of two families had bladder control 
      abnormalities. Unlike previous reported cases, Italian SPG8 subjects have pure form 
      of spastic paraparesis without cranial nerve involvement, and onset is in adult 
      life. DISCUSSION: By a clinical point of view, it is hard to differentiate SPG8 from 
      the SPG4, in which bladder and vibration sense dysfunctions are frequent signs. The 
      differential diagnosis with other forms of AD-HSPs seems relatively easier if one 
      considers the early-onset manifestations in SPG3A and the peripheral nervous system 
      and cerebellar involvement seen in SPG31.

TI  - Living with Parkinson's-past, present and future: a qualitative study of the 
      subjective perspective.
PG  - 764-771
LID - 10.12968/bjon.2019.28.12.764 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: the social impact of Parkinson's is difficult to capture in quantitative 
      research given the condition's variable presentation, so qualitative research is 
      needed to support a person-centred approach. AIMS: to describe how people with 
      Parkinson's experience living with their condition over time. METHODS: 27 
      audio-recorded verbatim-transcribed interviews were analysed through the grounded 
      theory method. FINDINGS: past, present and future were the core categories that 
      emerged. Past is the dimension of regretted memories of past life overturned by the 
      communication of diagnosis. Present is the time dimension in which patients 
      concretely experience the hindrances associated with the condition (loss of 
      autonomy, submissive acceptance and social embarrassment), and the resources (search 
      for autonomy, serene or in-progress acceptance, and social support). Future is 
      characterised by both positive visions of tomorrow and negative ones (worry, 
      resignation, denial). CONCLUSION: these results, highlighting what living with 
      Parkinson's means over time, may contribute to a better tailoring of nursing 
      practice to the person's needs and rhythm, in a perspective of continuous 
      adaptation.

AB  - KIF1A gene encodes the kinesin 1a protein, an axonal motor protein participating in 
      axonal transport. Variants in KIF1A were identified in different forms of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs) from a Chinese hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) patient carrying a 
      compound heterozygous c.773C>T(p.T258M) mutation in KIF1A gene by reprogramming 
      peripheral blood cells with non-integrative vectors. The generated iPSC line 
      (SDUBMSi001-A) had a normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers and could be 
      differentiated into three germ layers in vitro.

TI  - A Japanese SPG4 Patient with a Confirmed De Novo Mutation of the SPAST Gene.
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.4599-20 [doi]
AB  - Spastic paraplegia type 4 (SPG4) is caused by mutations of the SPAST gene and is the 
      most common form of autosomal-dominantly inherited pure hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP). We herein report a Japanese patient with SPG4 with a confirmed de 
      novo mutation of SPAST. On exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing, we identified the 
      heterozygous missense mutation p.R460L in the SPAST gene. This mutation was absent 
      in the parents, and the paternity and maternity of the parents were both confirmed. 
      The patient showed a pure SPG4 phenotype with an infantile onset. This study may 
      expand the clinical and genetic findings for SPG4.

AB  - IP(3) receptor turnover is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase RNF170, which is 
      recruited to active IP(3) receptors by the erlin1/2 complex. A new study by Wagner 
      et al (Nat Commun, 2019) links four cases of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia to 
      inactivating mutations in RNF170. This increases the number of examples of mutations 
      to the erlin1/2 complex-RNF170 module underlying neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Paediatric-onset hereditary spastic paraplegias: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1111/dmcn.14547 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe the clinical and neurogenetic spectrum of paediatric-onset 
      hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) diagnosed in our unit. METHOD: We report on 47 
      patients (30 males, 17 females; mean [SD] age 12y 7mo [6y 2mo], range 4-34y) 
      clinically diagnosed with an HSP at the Child Neurology Unit, IRCCS-ASMN (Reggio 
      Emilia, Italy) between 1990 and 2018, who were genetically investigated by means of 
      single-gene direct sequencing and/or next-generation sequencing technologies 
      (targeted panels, whole-exome sequencing [WES]). RESULTS: Complex forms prevailed 
      slightly (n=26), autosomal dominant being the main inheritance pattern (n=11), 
      followed by recessive (n=5) and X-linked (n=1). A definite genetic diagnosis was 
      achieved in 17 patients. Spastic paraplegia 3A (n=4) was the most frequent cause of 
      autosomal dominant HSP in our cohort, while no genetic variant prevailed in 
      autosomal recessive forms and pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were disclosed 
      in a wide range of different genes. INTERPRETATION: We found wide phenotypic and 
      genetic heterogeneity. With increasing accessibility to WES, a higher number of 
      patients receive a diagnosis, allowing detection of variants in ultra-rare 
      disease-causing genes and refining genotype-phenotype correlations. WHAT THIS PAPER 
      ADDS: A genetic diagnosis of paediatric-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia was 
      achieved in one-third of patients. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in rare 
      genes were found. Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity favours targeted 
      panel/whole-exome sequencing for diagnosis.

TI  - Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose 
      intolerance by modulating bile acid metabolism in hamsters.
PG  - 702-710
LID - 10.1016/j.apsb.2019.02.004 [doi]
AB  - Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in 
      hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for 
      studies of obesity-related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, 
      bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with 
      obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the 
      interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders 
      remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% 
      high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage 
      twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose 
      intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic 
      lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). 
      In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B 
      member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway was upregulated, 
      contributing to a more hydrophilic bile acid profile with increased 
      tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but 
      remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational 
      significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism 
      in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.

TI  - Selective dorsal rhizotomy for spasticity of genetic etiology.
PG  - 1357-1365
LID - 10.1007/s00381-020-04601-x [doi]
AB  - Objective Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is most commonly applied in the context 
      of the treatment of the spastic diplegic variant of cerebral palsy (CP). Its role in 
      the treatment of spasticity associated with other conditions is not 
      well-established. We sought to review outcomes following SDR for the treatment of 
      functionally limiting spasticity in the setting of a genetic etiology. Methods A 
      systematic literature review was performed using the databases Ovid Medline, Embase, 
      Cochrane Library, and PubMed based on the PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included 
      if they described the application of SDR for spasticity of genetic etiology. 
      Reported outcomes pertaining to spasticity and gross motor function following SDR 
      were summarized. Results Five articles reporting on 16 patients (10 males, 6 
      females) met the inclusion criteria, of which four reported on SDR for hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP) and four on syndromic patients or other inherited diseases, 
      with an overall follow-up ranging from 11 to 252 months. These individuals were 
      found to have several genetic mutations including ALS2, SPG4, and SPG3A. The mean 
      age at the time of surgery was 14.9 years (median 10 years, range 3-37 years). 
      Conclusions Although all patients experienced a reduction in spasticity, the 
      long-term gross motor functional outcomes objectively assessed at last follow-up 
      were heterogeneous. There may be a role for SDR in the context of static genetic 
      disorders causing spasticity. Further evidence is required prior to the widespread 
      adoption of SDR for such disorders as, based on the collective observations of this 
      review, spasticity is consistently reduced but the long-term effect on gross motor 
      function remains unclear.

TI  - Atlastin-mediated membrane tethering is critical for cargo mobility and exit from 
      the endoplasmic reticulum.
PG  - 14029-14038
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1908409116 [doi]
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane junctions are formed by the dynamin-like GTPase 
      atlastin (ATL). Deletion of ATL results in long unbranched ER tubules in cells, and 
      mutation of human ATL1 is linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia. Here, we 
      demonstrate that COPII formation is drastically decreased in the periphery of 
      ATL-deleted cells. ER export of cargo proteins becomes defective; ER exit site 
      initiation is not affected, but many of the sites fail to recruit COPII subunits. 
      The efficiency of cargo packaging into COPII vesicles is significantly reduced in 
      cells lacking ATLs, or when the ER is transiently fragmented. Cargo is less mobile 
      in the ER in the absence of ATL, but the cargo mobility and COPII formation can be 
      restored by ATL R77A, which is capable of tethering, but not fusing, ER tubules. 
      These findings suggest that the generation of ER junctions by ATL plays a critical 
      role in maintaining the necessary mobility of ER contents to allow efficient 
      packaging of cargo proteins into COPII vesicles.

TI  - Low-Dose Intrathecal Ziconotide for Spasticity From Primary Lateral Sclerosis: A 
      Case Report.
PG  - 31-33
LID - 10.1213/XAA.0000000000000978 [doi]
AB  - Spasticity can be very debilitating and painful. We present a case of severe 
      spasticity from primary lateral sclerosis refractory to intrathecal baclofen in 
      doses up to 1100 μg/d. Baclofen was weaned down and switched to intrathecal 
      ziconotide at 0.6 μg/d. The dose was then titrated up to 3 μg/d with excellent 
      control of spasticity. This case suggests that low-dose intrathecal ziconotide 
      should be considered in patients with lower extremity spasticity refractory to 
      intrathecal baclofen.

TI  - Spastin tethers lipid droplets to peroxisomes and directs fatty acid trafficking 
      through ESCRT-III.
PG  - 2583-2599
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201902061 [doi]
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid storage organelles that transfer lipids to 
      various organelles including peroxisomes. Here, we show that the hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia protein M1 Spastin, a membrane-bound AAA ATPase found on LDs, coordinates 
      fatty acid (FA) trafficking from LDs to peroxisomes through two interrelated 
      mechanisms. First, M1 Spastin forms a tethering complex with peroxisomal ABCD1 to 
      promote LD-peroxisome contact formation. Second, M1 Spastin recruits the 
      membrane-shaping ESCRT-III proteins IST1 and CHMP1B to LDs via its MIT domain to 
      facilitate LD-to-peroxisome FA trafficking, possibly through IST1- and 
      CHMP1B-dependent modifications in LD membrane morphology. Furthermore, 
      LD-to-peroxisome FA trafficking mediated by M1 Spastin is required to relieve LDs of 
      lipid peroxidation. M1 Spastin's dual roles in tethering LDs to peroxisomes and in 
      recruiting ESCRT-III components to LD-peroxisome contact sites for FA trafficking 
      may underlie the pathogenesis of diseases associated with defective FA metabolism in 
      LDs and peroxisomes.

TI  - POLR3A-related spastic ataxia: new mutations and a look into the phenotype.
PG  - 324-330
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09574-9 [doi]
AB  - Adolescent-onset spastic ataxia is a proposed novel phenotype in compound 
      heterozygous carriers of an intronic mutation (c.1909 + 22G > A) in the POLR3A gene. 
      Here, we present ten new cases of POLR3A-related spastic ataxia and discuss the 
      genetic, clinical and imaging findings. Patients belonged to six pedigrees with 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia or cerebellar ataxia of unknown origin. All affected 
      subjects presented with compound heterozygous variants, comprising c.1909 + 22G > A 
      in combination in each pedigree with one of the following novel mutations 
      (Thr596Met, Tyr665LeufsTer11, Glu198Ter, c.646-687_1185 + 844del). The new mutations 
      segregated with the phenotype in all families. The phenotype combined variable 
      cerebellar ataxia, gait and lower limb spasticity, involvement of central sensory 
      tracts and in some cases also intention tremor. The reportedly characteristic 
      hyperintensity along the superior cerebellar peduncle on MRI was observed in ~ 80% 
      of the cases. Our study extends the clinical and molecular phenotype further 
      supporting the pathogenic role of the c.1909 + 22G4A intronic mutation and 
      identifying four novel causative mutations in POLR3A-related spastic ataxia. Certain 
      characteristic MRI features may be useful to guide genetic diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias present a high variability of age at 
      onset, ranging from childhood to older age. Our objective was to identify the 
      determinants of age at onset in autosomal dominant HSP (AD-HSP) in a large cohort of 
      patients and families. METHODS: We included 239 patients from 89 families identified 
      in the Portuguese multisource population-based survey of hereditary ataxias and 
      spastic paraplegias. Patients were systematically examined by a team of 
      neurologists, admitted for complete clinical workup and tested for SPG3, SPG4 and 
      SPG31. RESULTS: Average age at onset was 38.2 years in the first generation, 
      32.3 years in the second and 17.5 years in the third, with a significant decrease of 
      average age at onset between generations (p < .001). A decrease in the average age 
      at onset was seen in all genotypes (SPG4: p < .001; SPG3: p = .15; SPG31: p < .001). 
      In families with more than one generation (n = 38), this decrease was observed in 
      78.9%. In multivariate linear regression model, the independent effect of generation 
      in anticipation of age at onset was confirmed (p < .001), adjusting for family, 
      genotype and mutation. We also observed a significant lower age at onset in patients 
      with missense versus truncating mutations (p = .015) in patients with SPG4. 
      CONCLUSION: These results confirm the impact of missense mutations in an earlier age 
      at onset in SPG4 patients. Even though the age at onset could be affected by 
      subjectivity, our results are consistent with the presence of an anticipation 
      phenomenon in AD-HSP.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in the nonimprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (NIPA1) 
      gene typically present with pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) but complex 
      cases are described. We present a patient with childhood idiopathic generalised 
      epilepsy (IGE) who later developed HSP. She rapidly deteriorated 27 years later with 
      clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Her family history included 
      HSP, IGE and motor neurone disease. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant 
      in the NIPA1 gene associated with spastic paraplegia 6 (SPG6). This case provides 
      the first description of NIPA1 in a family with epilepsy, ALS and thus complex HSP.

TI  - Aminoglycosides are efficient reagents to induce readthrough of premature 
      termination codon in mutant B4GALNT1 genes found in families of hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia.
LID - mvaa041 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvaa041 [doi]
AB  - The readthrough of premature termination codon (PTC) by ribosome sometimes produces 
      full-length proteins. We previously reported a readthrough of PTC of 
      glycosyltransferase gene B4GALNT1 with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here we 
      featured the readthrough of B4GALNT1 of two mutants, M4 and M2 with PTC by 
      immunoblotting and flow cytometry after transfection of B4GALNT1 cDNAs into cells. 
      Immunoblotting showed a faint band of full-length mutant protein of M4 but not M2 at 
      a similar position with that of wild type B4GALNT1. AGC sequences at immediately 
      before and after the PTC in M4 were critical for the readthrough. Treatment of cells 
      transfected with mutant M4 cDNA with aminoglycosides resulted in increased 
      readthrough of PTC. Furthermore, treatment of transfectants of mutant M2 cDNA with 
      G418 also resulted in the induction of readthrough of PTC. Both M4 and M2 
      cDNA-transfectants showed increased/induced bands in immunoblotting and GM2 
      expression in a dose-dependent manner of aminoglycosides. Results of mass 
      spectrometry supported this effect. Here, we showed for the first time the induction 
      and/or enhancement of the readthrough of PTCs of B4GALT1 by aminoglycoside 
      treatment, suggesting that aminoglycosides are efficient for patients with HSP 
      caused by PTC of B4GALNT1, in which gradual neurological disorders emerged with 
      aging.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000009559 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify preferred neurofilament assays and clinically validate serum 
      neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) as 
      prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) therapy development. METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, 
      longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n = 229), primary lateral 
      sclerosis (n = 20), and progressive muscular atrophy (n = 11), biological specimens 
      were collected, processed, and stored according to strict standard operating 
      procedures (SOPs). Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by 
      independent contract research organizations. RESULTS: For serum NfL and pNfH 
      measured using the Simoa assay, there were no missing data (i.e., technical 
      replicates below the lower limit of detection were not encountered). For the Iron 
      Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in ∼4% and ∼10% of 
      serum samples, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation for NfL in serum and CSF 
      were both ∼3%. Mean coefficients of variation for pNfH in serum and CSF were ∼4%-5% 
      and ∼2%-3%, respectively, in all assays. Baseline serum NfL concentration, but not 
      pNfH, predicted the future Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) slope and 
      survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R 
      slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of ∼8%. Depending on the method used 
      to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic 
      biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size 
      savings. CONCLUSIONS: Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic 
      biomarker for ALS. Serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH), quantified using the Simoa assay, 
      has potential utility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of treatment effect.

TI  - Progressive supranuclear palsy and primary lateral sclerosis secondary to globular 
      glial tauopathy: a case report and a practical theoretical framework for the 
      clinical prediction of this rare pathological entity.
PG  - 91-97
LID - 10.1080/13554794.2020.1732427 [doi]
AB  - Globular glial tauopathy (GGT) is a rare 4-repeat tauopathy characterized by the 
      accumulation of tau globular inclusions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Several 
      clinical phenotypes have been associated with GGT, making the prediction of this 
      rare pathological entity difficult. We report the case of a patient with 
      eye-movement abnormalities and gait instability, reminiscent of progressive 
      supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), who later developed upper motor 
      neuron symptoms suggestive of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Neuropathological 
      assessment revealed GGT type III pathology. A theoretical framework is proposed to 
      help clinicians predict GGT in subjects with coexistent features of PSP-RS and PLS.

TI  - Autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by mutation of UBAP1.
PG  - 169-177
LID - 10.1007/s10048-020-00608-3 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases 
      characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis. UBAP1 was recently found to induce 
      a rare type of HSP (SPG80). We identified a family with eight inherited spastic 
      paraplegic patients carrying a novel heterozygous mutation c.279delG (p.S94Vfs*9) of 
      UBAP1. We demonstrated a lack of functional UBAP1 in these patients, resulting in 
      the neurological disorder caused by interceptions of the ESCRT pathway. Extending 
      from the older onset-age identified from this family, we found that comparing with 
      the European and other populations, Asian patients displayed less proportion of 
      severe patients and an older average age at onset. The origins of SPG80 patients 
      associated with both their onset age and their disease severity, while the age at 
      onset was not correlated with the disease severity.

TI  - Microtubule-dependent and independent roles of spastin in lipid droplet dispersion 
      and biogenesis.
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202000715 [doi]
LID - e202000715
AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are metabolic organelles that store neutral lipids and 
      dynamically respond to changes in energy availability by accumulating or mobilizing 
      triacylglycerols (TAGs). How the plastic behavior of LDs is regulated is poorly 
      understood. Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a central motor axonopathy 
      predominantly caused by mutations in SPAST, encoding the microtubule-severing 
      protein spastin. The spastin-M1 isoform localizes to nascent LDs in mammalian cells; 
      however, the mechanistic significance of this targeting is not fully explained. 
      Here, we show that tightly controlled levels of spastin-M1 are required to inhibit 
      LD biogenesis and TAG accumulation. Spastin-M1 maintains the morphogenesis of the ER 
      when TAG synthesis is prevented, independent from microtubule binding. Moreover, 
      spastin plays a microtubule-dependent role in mediating the dispersion of LDs from 
      the ER upon glucose starvation. Our results reveal a dual role of spastin to shape 
      ER tubules and to regulate LD movement along microtubules, opening new perspectives 
      for the pathogenesis of hereditary spastic paraplegia.

AB  - Adult male muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) has a pair of scent glands which secret musk 
      to attract females during the breeding stage. The goal of the present study was to 
      investigate the genetic mechanisms of musk secretion of muskrats at the whole genome 
      level. Comparative genomics illustrated obvious expansion in 809 gene families, of 
      which nine gene families played pivotal roles in steroid biosynthesis, possibly 
      related to muskrat musk secretion. We identified 1112 positively selected genes 
      (PSGs) in the muskrat, including estrogen receptor 1 (ER1), an important influencing 
      factor to the weight and size of the scented glands of muskrats. HSD17B3, HSD17B4, 
      CYP7B1 and CYP17B1, crucial to steroid hormone biosynthesis, were under strong 
      positive selection in the muskrat, and phylogenetic analysis of HSD and CYP450 
      classes revealed high gene diversity. Functional enrichment revealed many pathways 
      associated with musk secretion and/or growth and degeneration of scented gland 
      significantly, such as peroxisome, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, apoptosis, and 
      prostate cancer. Two muskrat-specific missense mutations (Pro237Thr and Ser297Ile) 
      were detected in LIPC, which were reported to be involved cholesterol metabolic 
      process. More importantly, the missense mutations discovered in LIPC were classified 
      as deleterious by PolyPhen-2, possibly affecting the musk secretion of muskrats.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a new MATE gene located in the same chromosome arm 
      of the aluminium tolerance (Alt1) rye locus.
PG  - 691-700
LID - 10.1111/plb.13107 [doi]
AB  - Aluminium (Al) toxicity is the major constraint for crop productivity in acid soils. 
      Wild rye species (Secale spp.) exhibit high Al tolerance, being a good source of 
      genes related to this trait. The Alt1 locus located on the 6RS chromosome arm is one 
      of the four main loci controlling Al tolerance in rye and is known to harbour major 
      genes but, so far, none have been found. Through synteny among the short arm of the 
      rye chromosome 6R and the main grass species, we found a candidate MATE gene for the 
      Atl1 locus, later named ScMATE3, which was isolated and characterized in different 
      Secale species. The sequence comparisons revealed both intraspecific and 
      interspecific variability, with high sequence conservation in the Secale genus. SNP 
      with replacement substitution that changed the structure of the protein and can be 
      involved in the Al tolerance trait were found in ScMATE3 gene. The predicted 
      subcellular localization of ScMATE3 is the vacuolar membrane which, together with 
      the phylogenetic relationships performed with other MATE genes of the Poaceae 
      related to Al detoxification, suggest involvement of ScMATE3 in an internal 
      tolerance mechanism. Moreover, expression studies of this gene in rye corroborate 
      its contribution in some Al resistance mechanisms. The ScMATE3 gene is located on 
      the 6RS chromosome arm between the same markers in which the Alt1 locus is involved 
      in Al resistance mechanisms in rye, thus being a good candidate gene for this 
      function.

TI  - Atractylenolide I inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation by affecting 
      metabolism and stemness via AKT/mTOR signaling.
PG  - 153191
LID - S0944-7113(20)30024-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atractylenolide I (ATL-1) is a natural herbal compound used in 
      traditional Chinese medicine that has exhibited anti-cancer properties. The 
      anti-tumorigenic activity of ATL-1 against colorectal cancer (CRC) and the 
      underlying signaling pathways involved in its mechanisms are examined here. 
      HYPOTHESIS: ATL-1 exerts therapeutic effect against CRC by disrupting glucose 
      metabolism and cancer stem cell maintenance via AKT/mTOR pathway regulation. STUDY 
      DESIGN: In vitro studies were performed in COLO205 and HCT116 CRC cell lines and in 
      vivo studies were conducted in a mouse xenograft model of CRC tumor. METHODS: CRC 
      cells were treated with ATL-1 at various concentrations, with or without inhibitors 
      of AKT or mTOR. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, stemness maintenance, 
      glucose metabolism, and AKT/mTOR signaling were evaluated. CRC tumor-xenografted 
      mice were treated with an AKT inhibitor and/or ATL-1, and glucose metabolism and 
      stemness maintenance were examined in tumor tissues. RESULTS: ATL-1 significantly 
      inhibited the invasion of CRC cells by inducing their apoptosis, possibly via the 
      excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Glucose metabolism (Warburg effect) 
      was also altered and stem-like traits were suppressed by ATL-1. In addition, ATL-1 
      effectively acted as an inhibitor or AKT/mTOR by downregulating the phosphorylation 
      of proteins related to the AKT/mTOR pathway. In vivo studies showed that tumor 
      weight and volume were reduced by ATL-1 and that aerobic glycolysis, stemness 
      maintenance, and AKT/mTOR activation were impaired by ATL-1 in colorectal tumors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ATL-1 acts as an effective agent to suppress colorectal tumor 
      progression, mainly by inhibiting CRC cell proliferation through altering apoptosis, 
      glucose metabolism, and stem-like behavior. These processes were mediated by the 
      AKT/mTOR signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. ATL-1 may be a potential agent 
      to be used in molecular-targeted strategies for cancer treatment.

AB  - Adaptor protein (AP) complexes are heterotetramers that select cargo for inclusion 
      into transport vesicles. Five AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-5) have been described, each 
      with a distinct localisation and function. Furthermore, patients with a range of 
      disorders, particularly involving the nervous system, have now been identified with 
      mutations in each of the AP complexes. In many cases this has been correlated with 
      aberrantly localised membrane proteins. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and 
      the accompanying poster, we summarize what is known about the five AP complexes and 
      discuss how this helps to explain the clinical features of the different genetic 
      disorders.

LID - 513
AB  - Background: Drooling related to bulbar weakness and dysfunction is a common concern 
      in patients with neuromuscular disease. While there are numerous medications to 
      manage sialorrhea, they are often limited by side effects and lack of efficacy. 
      Botulinum toxin has shown to benefit ALS patients in a few studies, but there is 
      scant data on the benefit in other neuromuscular conditions. Objective: To assess 
      the effectiveness of Botulinum toxin in reducing sialorrhea in patients with various 
      neuromuscular disease. Design/Methods: 25 patients (19M, 6F; 54.36 ± 17.09 yr) with 
      documented neuromuscular illness and concern for drooling was followed for 6 weeks 
      after Botulinum toxin injection. These patients had one of the following diagnoses: 
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (3), myotonic dystrophy (3), oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy (1), inclusion body myositis (2), primary lateral sclerosis (1), 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (9), spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 3 (2), 
      spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (2), and Becker's muscular dystrophy (2). A 
      subjective drooling scale (1: markedly worse, 5: markedly better) and drooling 
      thickness score (0=normal, 100=thick) was calculated on these patients prior to the 
      injection and 4 and 6 weeks after the injection. Botulinum toxin 20-30 units were 
      injected into bilateral parotid gland (70% of the dose) and submandibular gland (30% 
      of the dose). Results: The drooling thickness score at before the injection was 75.2 
      ± 10.46. At 4 and 6 weeks, average scores reduced to 47.2 ± 6.14 and 18.8 ± 5.26, 
      respectively (p < 0.05). The average pre injection perception about drooling was 3.0 
      (p < 0.05). The average change in perception was +0.84 and +1.28 at 4 and 6 weeks, 
      respectively, (p < 0.05) implying significant improvement. There were no reported 
      adverse effects. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence for the use of 
      botulinum toxin for refractory sialorrhea for a variety of neuromuscular conditions.

TI  - Clinical Characterization of 2 Siblings with a Homozygous SPAST Variant.

AB  - BACKGROUND Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP or SPG) consists of a heterogeneous 
      group of disorders, clinically divided into pure and complex forms. The former is 
      characterized by neurological impairment limited to lower-extremity spasticity. The 
      latter presents additional symptoms such as seizures, psychomotor impairment, 
      cataract, deafness, and peripheral neuropathy. The genetic structure of HSP is 
      diverse, with more than 72 loci and 55 genes identified so far. The most common type 
      is SPG4, accounting for 40% of cases. This case report describes 2 siblings 
      presenting SPG4, one presumptive and one confirmed with a homozygous SPAST variant. 
      CASE REPORT Two siblings born to third-degree consanguineous and healthy parents 
      presented a SPG4 complex phenotype characterized by progressive psychomotor 
      deterioration, mixed seizure patterns, corneal opacity, dysostotic bones, limb 
      spasticity with extensor plantar responses, and axial hypotonia. After ruling out 
      most inborn errors of metabolism in one of the patients, the complexity of the case 
      derived from exome sequencing. The identification of a homozygous variant in the 
      SPAST gene established a diagnosis for SPG4. The phenotype-genotype did not 
      correlate to classical manifestations, most likely due to the variant's zygosity. 
      Moreover, 34 patient's relatives were identified with SPG4 clinical manifestations 
      or asymptomatic with the same genetic variant in heterozygous state. CONCLUSIONS We 
      described visual loss and seizures for SPG4 complex phenotype associated with a 
      homozygous variant in the SPAST gene. This diagnosis will lead clinicians to 
      consider it as a differential diagnosis providing adequate genetic counseling.

AB  - The enzyme β-glucosidase 2 (GBA2) is clinically relevant because it is targeted by 
      the drug miglustat (Zavesca®) and because it is involved in inherited diseases. 
      Mutations in the GBA2 gene are associated with two neurological diseases on the 
      ataxia-spasticity spectrum, hereditary spastic paraplegia 46 (SPG46) and 
      Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndrome (MSS). To establish how GBA2 mutations give rise to 
      neurological pathology, we have begun to investigate mutant forms of GBA2 encoded by 
      disease-associated GBA2 alleles. Previously, we found that five GBA2 missense 
      mutants and five C-terminally truncated mutants lacked enzyme activity. Here we have 
      examined the cellular locations of wild-type (WT) and mutant forms of GBA2 by 
      confocal and electron microscopy, using transfected cells. Similar to GBA2-WT, the 
      D594H and M510Vfs*17 GBA2 mutants were located at the plasma membrane, whereas the 
      C-terminally truncated mutants terminating after amino acids 233 and 339 (GBA2-233 
      and -339) were present in the mitochondrial matrix, induced mitochondrial 
      fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Deletional 
      mutagenesis indicated that residues 161-200 are critical for the mitochondrial 
      fragmentation of GBA2-233 and -339. Considering that the mitochondrial fragmentation 
      induced by GBA2-233 and -339 is consistently accompanied by their localization to 
      the mitochondrial matrix, our deletional analysis raises the possibility that that 
      GBA2 residues 161-200 harbor an internal targeting sequence for transport to the 
      mitochondrial matrix. Altogether, our work provides new insights into the behaviour 
      of GBA2-WT and disease-associated forms of GBA2.

TI  - Molecular analysis and clinical diversity of distal hereditary motor neuropathy.
PG  - 1319-1326
LID - 10.1111/ene.14260 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMNs) are a 
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The purpose of this 
      study was to identify the genetic distribution of dHMNs in a large cohort of Chinese 
      patients and provide insight into the underlying common pathophysiology of dHMNs. 
      METHODS: Multi-gene panel testing or whole-exome sequencing was performed in 70 
      index patients with clinically diagnosed dHMN between January 2007 and December 
      2018. The clinical features, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy scores and 
      electrophysiological data at diagnosis were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-four causative 
      mutations were identified in 70 index patients with dHMN (34.3%). Mutation in the 
      HSPB1 gene was the most common cause of dHMN. Some CMT genes (MPZ, SH3TC2, GDAP1) 
      were found to be related to dHMN with minor sensory involvement. Patients with a 
      dHMN-plus phenotype (distal motor neuropathy and additional neurological deficits) 
      carried variants in genes related to hereditary spastic paraplegia, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy (FUS, KIF5A, KIF1B, ZFYVE26, DNAJB2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive genetic testing of dHMN patients allows for 
      identification of the pathogenic mutation in one-third of cases. Pure motor 
      neuropathies and motor neuropathies with minor sensory involvement share many genes 
      with CMT disease. Causes for dHMN-plus phenotypes overlap with motor neuron disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial disorders are a group of rare diseases, caused by nuclear 
      or mitochondrial DNA mutations. Their marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity as 
      well as referral and ascertainment biases render phenotype-based prevalence 
      estimations difficult. Here we calculated the lifetime risk of all known autosomal 
      recessive mitochondrial disorders on basis of genetic data. METHODS: We queried the 
      publicly available Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and our in-house exome 
      database to assess the allele frequency of disease-causing variants in genes 
      associated with autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorders. Based on this, we 
      estimated the lifetime risk of 249 autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorders. 
      Three of these disorders and phenylketonuria (PKU) served as a proof of concept 
      since calculations could be aligned with known birth prevalence data from newborn 
      screening reports. FINDINGS: The estimated lifetime risks are very close to newborn 
      screening data (where available), supporting the validity of the approach. For 
      example, calculated lifetime risk of PKU (16·0/100,000) correlates well with known 
      birth prevalence data (18·7/100,000). The combined estimated lifetime risk of 249 
      investigated mitochondrial disorders is 31·8 (20·9-50·6)/100,000 in our in-house 
      database, 48·4 (40·3-58·5)/100,000 in the European gnomAD dataset, and 31·1 
      (26·7-36·3)/100,000 in the global gnomAD dataset. The disorders with the highest 
      lifetime risk (> 3 per 100,000) were, in all datasets, those caused by mutations in 
      the SPG7, ACADM, POLG and SLC22A5 genes. INTERPRETATION: We provide a 
      population-genetic estimation on the lifetime risk of an entire class of monogenic 
      disorders. Our findings reveal the substantial cumulative prevalence of autosomal 
      recessive mitochondrial disorders, far above previous estimates. These data will be 
      very important for assigning diagnostic a priori probabilities, and for resource 
      allocation in therapy development, public health management and biomedical research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Molecular genetic testing for hereditary neuromuscular disorders is 
      increasingly used to identify disease subtypes, determine prevalence, and inform 
      management and prognosis, and although many small disease-specific studies have 
      demonstrated the utility of genetic testing, comprehensive data sets are better 
      positioned to assess the complexity of genetic analysis. METHODS: Using high 
      depth-of-coverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) with simultaneous detection of 
      sequence variants and copy number variants (CNVs), we tested 25,356 unrelated 
      individuals for subsets of 266 genes. RESULTS: A definitive molecular diagnosis was 
      obtained in 20% of this cohort, with yields ranging from 4% among individuals with 
      congenital myasthenic syndrome to 33% among those with a muscular dystrophy. CNVs 
      accounted for as much as 39% of all clinically significant variants, with 10% of 
      them occurring as rare, private pathogenic variants. Multigene testing successfully 
      addressed differential diagnoses in at least 6% of individuals with positive 
      results. Even for classic disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, at least 49% 
      of clinically significant results were identified through gene panels intended for 
      differential diagnoses rather than through single-gene analysis. Variants of 
      uncertain significance (VUS) were observed in 53% of individuals. Only 0.7% of these 
      variants were later reclassified as clinically significant, most commonly in RYR1, 
      GDAP1, SPAST, and MFN2, providing insight into the types of evidence that support 
      VUS resolution and informing expectations of reclassification rates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data provide guidance for clinicians using genetic testing to diagnose 
      neuromuscular disorders and represent one of the largest studies demonstrating the 
      utility of NGS-based testing for these disorders.

TI  - Combined brain and spinal FDG PET allows differentiation between ALS and ALS mimics.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04786-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder with on average a 1-year delay between symptom onset and diagnosis. Studies 
      have demonstrated the value of [(18)F]-FDG PET as a sensitive diagnostic biomarker, 
      but the discriminatory potential to differentiate ALS from patients with symptoms 
      mimicking ALS has not been investigated. We investigated the combination of brain 
      and spine [(18)F]-FDG PET-CT for differential diagnosis between ALS and ALS mimics 
      in a real-life clinical diagnostic setting. METHODS: Patients with a suspected 
      diagnosis of ALS (n = 98; 64.8 ± 11 years; 61 M) underwent brain and spine 
      [(18)F]-FDG PET-CT scans. In 62 patients, ALS diagnosis was confirmed 
      (67.8 ± 10 years; 35 M) after longitudinal follow-up (average 18.1 ± 8.4 months). In 
      23 patients, another disease was diagnosed (ALS mimics, 60.9 ± 12.9 years; 17 M) and 
      13 had a variant motor neuron disease, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS; n = 4; 
      53.6 ± 2.5 years; 2 M) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA; n = 9; 
      58.4 ± 7.3 years; 7 M). Spine metabolism was determined after manual and automated 
      segmentation. VOI- and voxel-based comparisons were performed. Moreover, a support 
      vector machine (SVM) approach was applied to investigate the discriminative power of 
      regional brain metabolism, spine metabolism and the combination of both. RESULTS: 
      Brain metabolism was very similar between ALS mimics and ALS, whereas cervical and 
      thoracic spine metabolism was significantly different (in standardised uptake 
      values; cervical: ALS 2.1 ± 0.5, ALS mimics 1.9 ± 0.4; thoracic: ALS 1.8 ± 0.3, ALS 
      mimics 1.5 ± 0.3). As both brain and spine metabolisms were very similar between ALS 
      mimics and PLS/PMA, groups were pooled for accuracy analyses. Mean discrimination 
      accuracy was 65.4%, 80.0% and 81.5%, using only brain metabolism, using spine 
      metabolism and using both, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of brain and 
      spine FDG PET-CT with SVM classification is useful as discriminative biomarker 
      between ALS and ALS mimics in a real-life clinical setting.

AB  - Mutations in the PARK2 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of early-onset 
      Parkinson's disease. We present a case of movement disorder in a 4-year-old child 
      from consanguineous parents and with a family history of Dopamine responsive 
      dystonia, who was diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's disease based on initial 
      identification of a pathogenic PARK2 mutation. However, the evolution of the child's 
      clinical picture was unusually rapid, with a preponderance of pyramidal rather than 
      extrapyramidal symptoms, leading to re-investigation of the case with further 
      imaging and genetic sequencing. Interestingly, a second homozygous mutation in the 
      FA2H gene, implicated in Hereditary spastic paraplegia, was revealed, appearing to 
      have contributed to the novel phenotype observed, and highlighting a potential 
      interaction between the two mutated genes.

AB  - We report the first three Japanese patients with missense variants in the GNB1 gene. 
      Patients exhibited severe dyskinetic quadriplegia with cortical blindness and 
      epileptic spasms, West syndrome (but with good outcomes), and hypotonic quadriplegia 
      that later developed into spastic diplegia. Whole-exome sequencing revealed two 
      recurrent GNB1 variants (p.Leu95Pro and p.Ile80Thr) and one novel variant 
      (p.Ser74Leu). A recent investigation revealed large numbers of patients with GNB1 
      variants. Functional studies of such variants and genotype-phenotype correlation are 
      required to enable future precision medicine.

      Fraternal Twins.
LID - 10.7916/tohm.v0.641 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: KIF1C (Kinesin Family Member 1C) variants have been associated with 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia and spastic ataxia. CASE REPORT: We report fraternal 
      twins presenting with cerebellar ataxia and dystonic tremor. Their brain MRI showed 
      a hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing identified a 
      homozygous KIF1C variant in both patients. DISCUSSION: KIF1C variants can manifest 
      as a complex movement disorder with cerebellar ataxia and dystonic tremor. KIF1C 
      variants may also cause a hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy.

TI  - ESCRT-III-associated proteins and spastin inhibit protrudin-dependent polarised 
      membrane traffic.

AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule severing ATPase spastin are the most 
      frequent cause of hereditary spastic paraplegia, a genetic condition characterised 
      by length-dependent axonal degeneration. Here, we show that HeLa cells lacking 
      spastin and embryonic fibroblasts from a spastin knock-in mouse model become highly 
      polarised and develop cellular protrusions. In HeLa cells, this phenotype was 
      rescued by wild-type spastin, but not by forms unable to sever microtubules or 
      interact with endosomal ESCRT-III proteins. Cells lacking the spastin-interacting 
      ESCRT-III-associated proteins IST1 or CHMP1B also developed protrusions. The 
      protrusion phenotype required protrudin, a RAB-interacting protein that interacts 
      with spastin and localises to ER-endosome contact sites, where it promotes 
      KIF5-dependent endosomal motility to protrusions. Consistent with this, the 
      protrusion phenotype in cells lacking spastin also required KIF5. Lack or mutation 
      of spastin resulted in functional consequences for receptor traffic of a pathway 
      implicated in HSP, as Bone Morphogenetic Protein receptor distribution became 
      polarised. Our results, therefore, identify a novel role for ESCRT-III proteins and 
      spastin in regulating polarised membrane traffic.

TI  - A novel mutation in the GBA2 gene in a Japanese patient with SPG46: A case report.
PG  - 100238
LID - 10.1016/j.ensci.2020.100238 [doi]
LID - 100238
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      pyramidal weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. SPG46, one of autosomal 
      recessive HSP, is clinically characterized by spasticity and pyramidal weakness of 
      the lower limbs, mental retardation, congenital bilateral cataract, thin corpus 
      callosum, and hypogonadism in males. Mutations in the nonlysosomal 
      glucosylceramidase β2 (GBA2) gene have been identified in patients with SPG46. A 
      Japanese woman was identified with bilateral cataracts when she was in an elementary 
      school. She felt falling easily, speaking unclearness, and difficulty in walking and 
      raising her left leg in her 30s. Her neurological examination at the age of 44 
      revealed dysarthria, spasticity in the upper and lower extremities, increased jaw 
      jerk and tendon reflexes in the extremities, bilateral extensor plantar reflexes, 
      ataxia, and pollakiuria. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thinning of the corpus 
      callosum body as well as atrophy in the pons and cerebellum. A novel homozygous 
      c.1838A > G (p.D613G) missense mutation was detected at exon 12 in GBA2. We 
      diagnosed her illness as an autosomal-recessive form of hereditary SPG46. The 
      clinical features matched previously reported phenotype of SPG46. This is the first 
      report of a Japanese patient with SPG46 with a novel mutation in GBA2. We presume 
      that the novel GBA2 missense mutation found in our patient would cause loss of GBA2 
      activity, resulting in the neurological manifestations of SPG46.

TI  - Revisiting the complex architecture of ALS in Turkey: Expanding genotypes, shared 
      phenotypes, molecular networks, and a public variant database.
LID - 10.1002/humu.24055 [doi]
AB  - The last decade has proven that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is clinically 
      and genetically heterogeneous, and that the genetic component in sporadic cases 
      might be stronger than expected. This study investigates 1,200 patients to revisit 
      ALS in the ethnically heterogeneous yet inbred Turkish population. Familial ALS 
      (fALS) accounts for 20% of our cases. The rates of consanguinity are 30% in fALS and 
      23% in sporadic ALS (sALS). Major ALS genes explained the disease cause in only 35% 
      of fALS, as compared with ~70% in Europe and North America. Whole exome sequencing 
      resulted in a discovery rate of 42% (53/127). Whole genome analyses in 623 sALS 
      cases and 142 population controls, sequenced within Project MinE, revealed 
      well-established fALS gene variants, solidifying the concept of incomplete 
      penetrance in ALS. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with whole genome 
      sequencing data did not indicate a new risk locus. Coupling GWAS with a coexpression 
      network of disease-associated candidates, points to a significant enrichment for 
      cell cycle- and division-related genes. Within this network, literature text-mining 
      highlights DECR1, ATL1, HDAC2, GEMIN4, and HNRNPA3 as important genes. Finally, 
      information on ALS-related gene variants in the Turkish cohort sequenced within 
      Project MinE was compiled in the GeNDAL variant browser (www.gendal.org).

TI  - Permanent lesion to the corticospinal tract after therapy with capecitabine.
LID - 10.1136/bcr-2019-231248 [doi]
LID - e231248
AB  - Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine used to treat solid tumours such as 
      colorectal and breast cancer. A rare but severe side effect is capecitabine-induced 
      leukoencephalopathy, including bilateral lesion to the corticospinal tract. However, 
      neurological symptoms due to capecitabine treatment are usually reported to be 
      reversible after discontinuation of capecitabine. Here, we present the case of a 
      patient with bilateral degeneration of the corticospinal tract and progressive 
      spastic tetraplegia after chemotherapy with capecitabine mimicking primary lateral 
      sclerosis. Although therapy with capecitabine was ended, symptoms substantially 
      worsened over the following years and the patient finally died from aspiration 
      pneumonia almost 3 years after the application of capecitabine.

TI  - First-line exome sequencing in Palestinian and Israeli Arabs with neurological 
      disorders is efficient and facilitates disease gene discovery.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-020-0609-9 [doi]
AB  - A high rate of consanguinity leads to a high prevalence of autosomal recessive 
      disorders in inbred populations. One example of inbred populations is the Arab 
      communities in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In the Palestinian Authority in 
      particular, due to limited access to specialized medical care, most patients do not 
      receive a genetic diagnosis and can therefore neither receive genetic counseling nor 
      possibly specific treatment. We used whole-exome sequencing as a first-line 
      diagnostic tool in 83 Palestinian and Israeli Arab families with suspected 
      neurogenetic disorders and were able to establish a probable genetic diagnosis in 
      51% of the families (42 families). Pathogenic, likely pathogenic or highly 
      suggestive candidate variants were found in the following genes extending and 
      refining the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of these rare disorders: ACO2, 
      ADAT3, ALS2, AMPD2, APTX, B4GALNT1, CAPN1, CLCN1, CNTNAP1, DNAJC6, GAMT, GPT2, 
      KCNQ2, KIF11, LCA5, MCOLN1, MECP2, MFN2, MTMR2, NT5C2, NTRK1, PEX1, POLR3A, 
      PRICKLE1, PRKN, PRX, SCAPER, SEPSECS, SGCG, SLC25A15, SPG11, SYNJ1, TMCO1, and 
      TSEN54. Further, this cohort has proven to be ideal for prioritization of new 
      disease genes. Two separately published candidate genes (WWOX and PAX7) were 
      identified in this study. Analyzing the runs of homozygosity (ROHs) derived from the 
      Exome sequencing data as a marker for the rate of inbreeding, revealed significantly 
      longer ROHs in the included families compared with a German control cohort. The 
      total length of ROHs correlated with the detection rate of recessive disease-causing 
      variants. Identification of the disease-causing gene led to new therapeutic options 
      in four families.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) caused by mutations in the SPAST (SPG4) gene 
      are autosomal-dominant inherited disorders characterized by weakness of lower 
      extremities, spasticity and hyperreflexia. Some cases with cognitive decline have 
      been repored. Herein we present an asymptomatic carrier of a SPAST gene mutation who 
      developed an adult-onset cognitive decline, compatible with Alzheimer's disease with 
      co-pathologies such as argyrophylic grain disease and cerebrovascular pathology. No 
      pathological changes described in HSP patients were present in this case.

TI  - Novel MAG Variant Causes Cerebellar Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia: Molecular Basis 
      and Expanded Clinical Phenotype.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9041212 [doi]
LID - 1212
AB  - Homozygous variants in MAG, encoding myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), have been 
      associated with complicated forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). MAG is a 
      glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, expressed by myelination 
      cells. In this study, we identified a novel homozygous missense variant in MAG 
      (c.124T>C; p.Cys42Arg) in a Portuguese family with early-onset autosomal recessive 
      cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and oculomotor apraxia. We used homozygosity 
      mapping and exome sequencing to identify the MAG variant, and cellular studies to 
      confirm its detrimental effect. Our results showed that this variant reduces protein 
      stability and impairs the post-translational processing (N-linked glycosylation) and 
      subcellular localization of MAG, thereby associating a loss of protein function with 
      the phenotype. Therefore, MAG variants should be considered in the diagnosis of 
      hereditary cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, in addition to spastic 
      paraplegia.

TI  - ANO9 Regulated Cell Cycle in Human Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-020-08368-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported the function and activation mechanism of ANO9 
      in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The current study aimed to investigate 
      the role of ANO9 in the regulation of tumor progression. METHODS: Knockdown 
      experiments with human ESCC cell lines were performed using ANO9 siRNA, and the 
      effects on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular movement were 
      analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed on 57 primary tumor 
      samples obtained from ESCC patients. RESULTS: In an in vitro study, depletion of 
      ANO9 reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in KYSE150 and KYSE 790 
      cells. In the cell cycle analysis, depletion of ANO9 increased the number of cells 
      in G(0)/G(1) arrest. In addition, the knockdown of ANO9 increased apoptosis. The 
      results of the microarray analysis indicated that various centrosome-related genes 
      such as CEP120, CNTRL, and SPAST were up- or downregulated in ANO9-depleted KYSE150 
      cells. The IHC results showed that high expression of ANO9 was associated with poor 
      prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that ANO9 regulates 
      the cell cycle via centrosome-related genes in ESCC.

AB  - Although genetic factors are considered a main etiology of epilepsy, the causes of 
      genetic epilepsy in the majority of epilepsy patients remain unknown. Kinesin family 
      member 1A (KIF1A), a neuron-specific motor protein that moves along with 
      microtubules, is responsible for the transport of membranous organelles and synaptic 
      vesicles. Variants of KIF1A have recently been associated with hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia (HSP), hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2 (HSANII), and 
      intellectual disability. However, mutations in KIF1A have not been detected in 
      patients with epilepsy. In our study, we conducted customized sequencing of 
      epilepsy-related genes of a family with six patients with generalized epilepsy over 
      three generations and identified a rare heterozygous mutation (c.1190C > A, p. 
      Ala397Asp) in KIF1A. Whole-cell recordings from primary cultured neurons revealed 
      that the mutant KIF1A increases the excitatory synaptic transmission but not the 
      intrinsic excitability of neurons, and phenotype testing in zebrafish showed that 
      this rare mutation results in epileptic seizure-like activity. These results provide 
      new evidence demonstrating that KIF1A dysfunction is involved in epileptogenesis.

AB  - The brain is complex and heterogeneous. Even though numerous independent studies 
      indicate cortical hyperexcitability as a potential contributor to amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, the mechanisms that are responsible for upper 
      motor neuron (UMN) vulnerability remain elusive. To reveal the electrophysiological 
      determinants of corticospinal motor neuron (CSMN, a.k.a UMN in mice) vulnerability, 
      we investigated the motor cortex of hSOD1(G93A) mice at P30 (postnatal day 30), a 
      presymptomatic time point. Glutamate uncaging by laser scanning photostimulation 
      (LSPS) revealed altered dynamics especially within the inhibitory circuitry and more 
      specifically in L2/3 of the motor cortex, whereas the excitatory microcircuits were 
      unchanged. Observed microcircuitry changes were specific to CSMN in the motor 
      column. Electrophysiological evaluation of the intrinsic properties in response to 
      the microcircuit changes, as well as the exon microarray expression profiles of CSMN 
      isolated from hSOD1(G93A) and healthy mice at P30, revealed the presence of a very 
      dynamic set of events, ultimately directed to establish, maintain and retain the 
      balance at this early stage. Also, the expression profile of key voltage-gated 
      potassium and sodium channel subunits as well as of the inhibitory GABA receptor 
      subunits and modulatory proteins began to suggest the challenges CSMN face at this 
      early age. Since neurodegeneration is initiated when neurons can no longer maintain 
      balance, the complex cellular events that occur at this critical time point help 
      reveal how CSMN try to cope with the challenges of disease manifestation. This 
      information is critically important for the proper modulation of UMNs and for 
      developing effective treatment strategies.

TI  - Dwarfism in Troyer syndrome: a family with SPG20 compound heterozygous mutations and 
      a literature review.
PG  - 118-127
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14229 [doi]
AB  - Troyer syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by spastic 
      paralysis, dysarthria, distal amyotrophy, and short stature. Recently, two siblings 
      (an older brother and a younger sister) were admitted to our hospital for the chief 
      complaints of "short stature and intellectual disability." Through whole exome 
      sequencing of the sister, who is the proband, it was found that her SPG20 gene had 
      compound heterozygous mutations: c.364_365delAT (p.Met122Valfs(*) 2) and c.892delA 
      (p.Thr298Glnfs(*) 30). Target testing revealed that the brother had the same 
      genotype as the sister, and the former mutation originated from the father, while 
      the latter mutation originated from the mother. In summary, this is the first report 
      of Troyer syndrome in a family caused by SPG20 compound heterozygous mutations. A 
      novel SPG20 mutation was found, namely c.892delA (p.Thr298Glnfs(*) 30). In addition, 
      we also summarize these Troyer syndrome patients' heights and their clinical 
      characteristics, and provide a brief review of all known pathogenic mutations of 
      SPG20.

TI  - The FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex interacts with AP-4 to mediate perinuclear 
      distribution of AP-4 and its cargo ATG9A.
PG  - 963-979

AB  - The heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4) is a component of a protein 
      coat associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Mutations in AP-4 subunits cause 
      a complicated form of autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia termed 
      AP-4-deficiency syndrome. Recent studies showed that AP-4 mediates export of the 
      transmembrane autophagy protein ATG9A from the TGN to preautophagosomal structures. 
      To identify additional proteins that cooperate with AP-4 in ATG9A trafficking, we 
      performed affinity purification-mass spectrometry followed by validation of the hits 
      by biochemical and functional analyses. This approach resulted in the identification 
      of the fused toes homolog-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex as a novel AP-4 accessory factor. 
      We found that the AP-4-FHF interaction is mediated by direct binding of the AP-4 μ4 
      subunit to coiled-coil domains in the Hook1 and Hook2 subunits of FHF. Knockdown of 
      FHF subunits resulted in dispersal of AP-4 and ATG9A from the perinuclear region of 
      the cell, consistent with the previously demonstrated role of the FHF complex in 
      coupling organelles to the microtubule (MT) retrograde motor dynein-dynactin. These 
      findings thus uncover an additional mechanism for the distribution of ATG9A within 
      cells and provide further evidence for a role of protein coats in coupling transport 
      vesicles to MT motors.

TI  - An autosomal dominant ERLIN2 mutation leads to a pure HSP phenotype distinct from 
      the autosomal recessive ERLIN2 mutations (SPG18).

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder that 
      manifests with lower extremity weakness and spasticity. HSP can be inherited by 
      autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked inheritance patterns. Recent 
      studies have shown that, although rare, mutations in a single gene can lead to 
      multiple patterns of inheritance of HSP. We enrolled the HSP family showing 
      autosomal dominant inheritance and performed genetic study to find the cause of 
      phenotype in this family. We recruited five members of a Korean family as study 
      participants. Four of the five family members had pure HSP. Part of the family 
      members underwent whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the causative mutation. 
      As the result of WES and Sanger sequencing analysis, a novel missense mutation 
      (c.452 C > T, p.Ala151Val) of ERLIN2 gene was identified as the cause of the 
      autosomal dominant HSP in the family. Our study suggests that the ERLIN2 gene leads 
      to both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant patterns of inheritance in HSP. 
      Moreover, autosomal dominant HSP caused by ERLIN2 appears to cause pure HSP in 
      contrast to autosomal recessive ERLIN2 related complicated HSP (SPG18).

TI  - Topiramate-Responsive Tremor in a Novel Pathogenic Variant of SPG15 Patient.
LID - 10.1097/WNF.0000000000000392 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is group of a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      with both genetically and clinically diverse neurologic features. Indeed, disease 
      progression is varying greatly within the different forms and current treatment 
      modalities are exclusively symptomatic for HSP. Tremor in HSP patients is only 
      mentioned with rare case reports, so treatment option is lack in clinical ground. We 
      reported a case of a HSP-15 girl with a previously reported novel mutation of SPG15 
      complained of a life disturbing tremor and topiramate as a drug therapy for tremor 
      in our HSP patient.
